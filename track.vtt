00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:38.682
Hello

3
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:40.939
Yes?

4
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.059
What?

5
00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:46.983
Sir, kindly switch off your
mobile phone

6
00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:49.233
Just one sec, please

7
00:02:00.068 --> 00:02:01.146
Excuse me

8
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:21.645
Excuse me

9
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:22.978
Sir, please sit down

10
00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:34.607
Captain, there's a
medical emergency

11
00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.523
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle

12
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.517
Delhi, Air India 101 returning
due to medical emergency

13
00:02:48.483 --> 00:02:49.395
Excuse me, sir

14
00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:02.977
Hold on!

15
00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:16.684
I'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please

16
00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.517
Wait

17
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.229
Get the car.
- Mr. Dhillon?

18
00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:54.761
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

19
00:03:57.896 --> 00:03:58.761
To the hotel, sir?

20
00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.640
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

21
00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.472
Step on the gas, dude!

22
00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:19.259
Yeah, Farhan?

23
00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.884
Get ready. I'll pick you up
in five minutes

24
00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:23.093
What happened?

25
00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.137
Chatur called. Remember him?

26
00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:27.180
The 'Silencer'?

27
00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:28.266
Yeah

28
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.809
He said Rancho is coming

29
00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:34.933
What?

30
00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:38.800
He said: Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

31
00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:41.343
Oh shucks!

32
00:04:41.477 --> 00:04:42.390
Hurry.

33
00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:43.722
Ok

34
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.013
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

35
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:54.090
We found our buddy

36
00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:57.717
What?

37
00:04:58.727 --> 00:05:00.101
Tell me later, bye

38
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.434
You forgot your pants

39
00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:13.846
Now to the hotel, sir?

40
00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:17.057
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering

41
00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:18.555
Ok sir

42
00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:19.590
Forgot my socks

43
00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:21.506
More than just your socks

44
00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:23.384
Your pants

45
00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:24.507
Oh no

46
00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:40.222
Now get my brother
from the airport

47
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.547
Same last name: Dhillon

48
00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:45.304
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

49
00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:06.672
Hey Rancho

50
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:08.467
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

51
00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.425
Rancho

52
00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:12.255
Where's Rancho?

53
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:14.964
Welcome, idiots

54
00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:20.671
Some 'madeira' for you?

55
00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:25.429
The same rum you
guzzled those days

56
00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:27.343
Have a drink

57
00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:29.212
Where is Rancho?

58
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.011
Patience. First look at this

59
00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:37.423
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

60
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.679
$ 3.5 million

61
00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:42.802
Swimming pool: heated.

62
00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:46.092
Living room: maple wood flooring

63
00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:49.962
My new Lambhorghini 6496 cc -

64
00:06:50.763 --> 00:06:51.758
very fast

65
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.921
Why're you showing us all this?

66
00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:55.462
Forgot?

67
00:06:58.721 --> 00:06:59.586
What's this?

68
00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.010
'5th September'. Today's date

69
00:07:19.887 --> 00:07:21.629
I challenge you

70
00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:24.049
We'll meet again after ten years

71
00:07:24.428 --> 00:07:26.419
Same day. Same place

72
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.672
We'll see who's more successful

73
00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:34.752
Have the balls? C'mon, bet;

74
00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:40.424
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

75
00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:44.045
I kept my promise. I'm back

76
00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:48.832
Jackass; I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

77
00:07:48.928 --> 00:07:50.041
all to meet Rancho

78
00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:53.089
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

79
00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:55.885
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

80
00:07:56.094 --> 00:08:00.218
I know he won't show up

81
00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:02.710
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

82
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.920
So why'd you call us here?

83
00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.296
To meet Rancho

84
00:08:07.718 --> 00:08:11.842
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

85
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.384
So you know where Rancho is?

86
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.551
Yes

87
00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:18.923
Where?

88
00:08:20.176 --> 00:08:21.966
He is in Shimla

89
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:33.419
Free as the wind was he

90
00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:40.259
Like a soaring kite was he

91
00:08:42.134 --> 00:08:48.248
Where did he go... let's find him

92
00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:06.457
Free as the wind was he

93
00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:11.671
Like a soaring kite was he

94
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:17.170
Where did he go... let's find him

95
00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:23.545
We were led by the path we took

96
00:09:23.757 --> 00:09:26.921
While he carved a path of his own

97
00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:32.500
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

98
00:09:33.965 --> 00:09:37.247
We fretted about the morrow

99
00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:40.623
He simply reveled in today

100
00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:46.581
Living each moment to the fullest

101
00:09:47.923 --> 00:09:51.169
Where did he come from...

102
00:09:54.714 --> 00:09:58.494
He who touched our hearts
and vanished...

103
00:10:01.547 --> 00:10:05.126
Where did he go... let's find him

104
00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:14.994
In scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade...

105
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:18.371
In an endless desert, like an oasis...

106
00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:23.370
On a bruised heart,
like soothing balm was he

107
00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:28.668
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

108
00:10:28.838 --> 00:10:32.000
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

109
00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:37.711
Never hesitating to swim
against the tide

110
00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:42.660
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

111
00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:47.827
...Yet he was our dearest friend

112
00:10:49.587 --> 00:10:52.999
Where did he go... let's find him

113
00:10:53.337 --> 00:10:54.201
Rancho

114
00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:56.784
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

115
00:10:57.544 --> 00:11:00.744
He was as unique as his name

116
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:04.294
From birth we were taught -
Life is a race

117
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:07.744
Run fast or you 'll be trampled

118
00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:12.289
Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms

119
00:11:14.544 --> 00:11:18.158
1978. I was born at 5.15 pm

120
00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:21.412
At 5.16, my father announced

121
00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:26.123
My son will be an engineer.
- Farhan Qureshi. B.Tech. Engineer

122
00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:27.744
And my fate was sealed

123
00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:33.244
What I wanted to be... no one asked

124
00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:58.125
Raju Rastogi...
Ranchhoddas Chanchad

125
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:00.787
Room number?

126
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.663
D-26

127
00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:07.364
C'mon

128
00:12:07.624 --> 00:12:09.331
I'm Man Mohan. MM

129
00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.331
These engineers call me
Millimeter

130
00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:13.995
For eggs, bread, milk, laundry

131
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:15.866
finishing journals,
copying assignments

132
00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:19.621
I'm your guy. Fixed rates.
No bargaining

133
00:12:20.166 --> 00:12:21.788
Hey wait, hold this

134
00:12:24.332 --> 00:12:28.077
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte,
and their mother Gigabyte

135
00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:30.162
Go ahead, click -
this family doesn't bite

136
00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:38.702
Check him out...
another God-fearing soul

137
00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:45.702
Hi. Farhan Qureshi
- I'm Raju Rastogi

138
00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:51.195
Don't worry

139
00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:55.617
a few days here and
hell lose faith in God

140
00:12:56.664 --> 00:12:59.578
Then naked babes will be
on the wall, and he'll say -

141
00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:03.080
Oh God,
give me one chance with her

142
00:13:03.664 --> 00:13:04.825
Get out of here

143
00:13:05.497 --> 00:13:07.701
Four bucks. Two per bag

144
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.655
Here's five. Keep the change

145
00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:16.121
Thanks boss. For your tip,
here's one in return -

146
00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:20.286
Wear your best underwear tonight

147
00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:23.735
Why?

148
00:13:25.246 --> 00:13:28.362
Your Majesty, thou art great

149
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:31.569
Accept this humble offering

150
00:13:31.788 --> 00:13:33.695
Ha... here's a He-Man

151
00:13:35.454 --> 00:13:39.400
What a pretty piece.
Cute and compact

152
00:13:39.746 --> 00:13:41.202
A campus tradition: On Day 1...

153
00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:43.911
Freshmen must pay
their respects to Seniors

154
00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:46.280
in their underwear

155
00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:49.822
This is when we first saw Rancho

156
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.282
Spiderman

157
00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:01.698
Batman

158
00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:11.237
Fresh meat

159
00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:14.819
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped

160
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:15.775
Name?

161
00:14:15.869 --> 00:14:17.611
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad'

162
00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:21.784
What a mouthful;
Needs serious cramming

163
00:14:22.619 --> 00:14:23.567
Come on: pants off

164
00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:27.897
Being stubborn?

165
00:14:33.409 --> 00:14:35.863
Wet pants not good, kiddo.
Take them off

166
00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.032
Aal izz well
- What's that?

167
00:14:39.202 --> 00:14:40.778
Aal izz Well

168
00:14:40.868 --> 00:14:41.780
What did he say?

169
00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:45.110
Someone tell him.
Hey James Bond

170
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.440
Make him understand

171
00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:50.357
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you

172
00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:53.028
Hey 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

173
00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:56.697
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry

174
00:14:56.784 --> 00:14:58.241
so little slow in Hindi

175
00:14:58.367 --> 00:15:01.531
So explain slowly. No hurry

176
00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:04.945
Feeling cold?

177
00:15:05.701 --> 00:15:07.738
Pray undress

178
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:12.899
or he'll do
'urine-expulsion' on you

179
00:15:14.074 --> 00:15:15.817
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion';

180
00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:19.694
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

181
00:15:25.241 --> 00:15:26.899
Hey, come out of there

182
00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:36.437
Come out or...

183
00:15:37.573 --> 00:15:40.737
or I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door

184
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:52.279
If you aren't out by
the count of ten

185
00:15:53.073 --> 00:15:57.611
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

186
00:16:01.448 --> 00:16:02.395
One

187
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.864
Two

188
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.359
Three

189
00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:26.231
Four

190
00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:31.441
Five

191
00:16:37.655 --> 00:16:38.982
Six

192
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:46.483
Seven

193
00:16:52.987 --> 00:16:54.101
Eight

194
00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:00.434
Nine

195
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.147
Ten

196
00:17:56.943 --> 00:18:01.481
Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics

197
00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.686
We had studied it.
He applied it

198
00:18:09.942 --> 00:18:13.936
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE

199
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.433
Students called him Virus,
computer Virus

200
00:18:17.858 --> 00:18:20.394
Virus on the way, with eggs

201
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.181
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

202
00:18:24.483 --> 00:18:27.054
Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen

203
00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:31.431
He couldn 't bear anyone
getting ahead of him

204
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:38.431
To save time,
his shirts had Velcro

205
00:18:38.733 --> 00:18:40.107
and his ties had hooks

206
00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:46.690
He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously

207
00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:54.391
Everyday at 2 pm he took a
7 1/2 minute power nap

208
00:18:54.815 --> 00:18:56.059
with an opera as lullaby

209
00:18:59.273 --> 00:19:00.731
Govind, his valet, had instructions

210
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:06.972
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc

211
00:19:24.148 --> 00:19:26.552
What is this?
- Sir, nest

212
00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:28.970
Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

213
00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:30.058
Wrong

214
00:19:31.355 --> 00:19:32.978
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

215
00:19:34.064 --> 00:19:36.516
She lays her eggs in
other nests

216
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.395
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

217
00:19:43.313 --> 00:19:48.977
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

218
00:19:52.938 --> 00:19:53.932
Competition over

219
00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:58.802
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

220
00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:02.223
Compete or die

221
00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:06.302
You also are like the koel birds

222
00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:15.012
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

223
00:20:15.478 --> 00:20:20.468
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

224
00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:25.011
and only 200 are selected: You;

225
00:20:25.644 --> 00:20:30.267
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs

226
00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:34.889
My son... he tried for three years

227
00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:39.306
Rejected. Every time

228
00:20:41.643 --> 00:20:43.266
Remember, life is a race

229
00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:47.515
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

230
00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:50.099
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

231
00:20:52.394 --> 00:20:53.637
This is an astronaut pen

232
00:20:54.935 --> 00:20:57.554
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

233
00:20:58.393 --> 00:21:02.636
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

234
00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:07.302
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

235
00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.474
One day, when I was a student

236
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.516
the Director of our institute
called me

237
00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:14.220
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

238
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:15.808
'Come here;'
I got scared

239
00:21:17.184 --> 00:21:18.381
He showed me this pen

240
00:21:19.892 --> 00:21:22.131
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

241
00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:24.964
'I give it to you'

242
00:21:26.726 --> 00:21:30.719
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

243
00:21:31.392 --> 00:21:33.014
...pass it onto him'

244
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.425
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

245
00:21:38.808 --> 00:21:39.970
But no luck

246
00:21:42.558 --> 00:21:44.797
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

247
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.507
Good.
Put your hands down

248
00:21:54.224 --> 00:21:56.594
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

249
00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:58.378
One question, sir

250
00:21:59.974 --> 00:22:03.339
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

251
00:22:03.849 --> 00:22:06.515
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

252
00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:09.426
They'd have saved millions

253
00:22:22.431 --> 00:22:23.889
I will get back to you on this

254
00:22:27.931 --> 00:22:30.171
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

255
00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:33.630
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

256
00:22:33.847 --> 00:22:35.885
You deflated Virus's erection

257
00:22:36.098 --> 00:22:39.925
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

258
00:22:40.097 --> 00:22:42.502
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

259
00:22:42.847 --> 00:22:44.423
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

260
00:22:44.514 --> 00:22:47.844
Keep off my dad!
- Relax

261
00:22:48.347 --> 00:22:51.842
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

262
00:22:52.055 --> 00:22:57.470
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

263
00:22:58.179 --> 00:22:59.755
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

264
00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:03.172
If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school

265
00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:05.553
See that?
- He was different...

266
00:23:06.055 --> 00:23:09.217
He challenged conventions
at every stage

267
00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:12.547
A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest

268
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.338
We were robots, blindly following
our professors ' commands

269
00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:19.583
He was the only one
who was not a machine

270
00:23:19.762 --> 00:23:22.215
What is a machine?

271
00:23:27.553 --> 00:23:29.176
Why're you smiling?

272
00:23:30.845 --> 00:23:33.380
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

273
00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.673
I'm so happy to be here finally

274
00:23:37.428 --> 00:23:41.089
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

275
00:23:42.636 --> 00:23:45.918
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

276
00:23:46.344 --> 00:23:47.718
Will you please elaborate?

277
00:23:51.302 --> 00:23:56.504
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

278
00:23:58.385 --> 00:24:00.672
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

279
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.134
The fan... A machine;

280
00:24:02.802 --> 00:24:05.919
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

281
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.175
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

282
00:24:09.926 --> 00:24:11.881
We're surrounded by machines

283
00:24:12.427 --> 00:24:14.915
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

284
00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:17.747
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

285
00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:22.043
What is the definition?

286
00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:24.459
I just gave it to you, sir

287
00:24:26.134 --> 00:24:29.665
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine: up, down...

288
00:24:30.509 --> 00:24:32.464
Idiot; Anybody else?

289
00:24:33.176 --> 00:24:34.040
Yes?

290
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.705
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

291
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.376
that their relative motions
are constrained

292
00:24:38.508 --> 00:24:40.913
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

293
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.336
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

294
00:24:43.466 --> 00:24:46.133
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

295
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.337
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

296
00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:50.332
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

297
00:24:50.424 --> 00:24:53.754
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

298
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:56.039
Wonderful

299
00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:57.798
Perfect. Please sit down

300
00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.376
Thank you

301
00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:03.798
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

302
00:25:04.007 --> 00:25:07.953
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

303
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:09.962
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

304
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:13.582
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

305
00:25:13.841 --> 00:25:15.463
You think you're smarter
than the book?

306
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.793
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

307
00:25:20.964 --> 00:25:22.706
But there are other books...
- Get out!

308
00:25:23.714 --> 00:25:24.994
Why?

309
00:25:25.173 --> 00:25:27.211
In simple language: Out;

310
00:25:37.047 --> 00:25:37.996
Idiot;

311
00:25:40.047 --> 00:25:42.536
So, we were discussing
the machine...

312
00:25:44.131 --> 00:25:45.078
Why're you back?

313
00:25:46.214 --> 00:25:47.292
I forgot something

314
00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:48.786
What?

315
00:25:49.922 --> 00:25:52.244
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

316
00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:54.661
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

317
00:25:54.797 --> 00:25:56.704
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non-jacketed

318
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.835
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

319
00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:00.746
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

320
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:02.580
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

321
00:26:02.713 --> 00:26:04.833
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

322
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:12.626
What do you mean?

323
00:26:12.879 --> 00:26:14.159
Books, sir

324
00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:17.124
I forgot my books. May I?

325
00:26:17.504 --> 00:26:19.162
Couldn't you ask simply?

326
00:26:19.587 --> 00:26:22.787
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

327
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:31.915
Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in

328
00:26:32.337 --> 00:26:35.169
When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another

329
00:26:35.628 --> 00:26:39.621
He said: First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it

330
00:26:40.086 --> 00:26:41.413
He was unlike any of us

331
00:26:42.253 --> 00:26:44.043
We fought for a shower
every morning

332
00:26:44.628 --> 00:26:46.867
He'd bathe
wherever he found water

333
00:26:47.045 --> 00:26:47.909
Morning, sir

334
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.626
Machines were his passion

335
00:26:51.877 --> 00:26:56.167
When he spotted them,
he opened them

336
00:26:56.503 --> 00:26:57.497
Some he could re-assemble...

337
00:26:58.586 --> 00:26:59.913
some he couldn 't

338
00:27:00.794 --> 00:27:03.282
There was another, just like him

339
00:27:06.085 --> 00:27:07.329
Joy Lobo

340
00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:09.785
Sir. Excuse me, sir

341
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:11.865
Mr. Joy Lobo;

342
00:27:12.793 --> 00:27:15.198
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

343
00:27:15.335 --> 00:27:16.163
Why?

344
00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:18.076
Dad wants to make
train reservations

345
00:27:18.459 --> 00:27:21.956
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

346
00:27:22.834 --> 00:27:25.038
In that case, call your dad

347
00:27:25.751 --> 00:27:27.623
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

348
00:27:34.209 --> 00:27:35.074
Hello

349
00:27:35.209 --> 00:27:38.242
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

350
00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:39.412
Joy;

351
00:27:39.626 --> 00:27:42.030
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

352
00:27:43.583 --> 00:27:44.532
What happened, sir?

353
00:27:44.625 --> 00:27:46.781
He has violated all deadlines

354
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.864
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

355
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:52.914
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

356
00:27:53.208 --> 00:27:57.830
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

357
00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:02.446
Sir, I am this close, sir
- Is your project ready?

358
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.827
Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please

359
00:28:06.957 --> 00:28:08.580
Submit it, and we'll consider

360
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.072
Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

361
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:14.282
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

362
00:28:14.416 --> 00:28:15.659
Did you stop eating?

363
00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:17.195
No

364
00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:18.328
Stopped bathing?

365
00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:20.363
So why stop studying?

366
00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:23.200
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

367
00:28:23.332 --> 00:28:24.494
Mr. Lobo;

368
00:28:24.832 --> 00:28:27.699
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

369
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:32.951
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

370
00:28:35.373 --> 00:28:38.122
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

371
00:28:39.165 --> 00:28:40.788
Sir... I'm very close...

372
00:29:10.913 --> 00:29:12.868
Lifelong I lived

373
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.283
The life of another

374
00:29:15.496 --> 00:29:17.783
For just one moment

375
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:20.527
Let me live as I...

376
00:29:20.745 --> 00:29:22.702
Lifelong I lived

377
00:29:23.037 --> 00:29:25.194
The life of another

378
00:29:25.454 --> 00:29:27.491
For just one moment

379
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.324
Let me live as I...

380
00:29:40.454 --> 00:29:44.992
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

381
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:50.193
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

382
00:29:50.287 --> 00:29:54.824
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

383
00:29:55.161 --> 00:30:00.909
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

384
00:30:01.952 --> 00:30:03.362
Dude's come up with an
amazing design

385
00:30:03.744 --> 00:30:05.201
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

386
00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:09.693
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

387
00:30:10.078 --> 00:30:12.992
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

388
00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:15.282
It will fly; We'll make it fly

389
00:30:17.577 --> 00:30:19.781
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

390
00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:22.820
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

391
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.531
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

392
00:30:26.035 --> 00:30:29.116
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

393
00:30:29.785 --> 00:30:30.946
You scare easily, bro

394
00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:36.564
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

395
00:30:36.784 --> 00:30:38.941
All is well?
- Aal izz well

396
00:30:39.243 --> 00:30:41.613
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

397
00:30:42.118 --> 00:30:44.238
We had an old watchman
in our village

398
00:30:44.993 --> 00:30:50.325
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

399
00:30:50.992 --> 00:30:54.440
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

400
00:30:54.617 --> 00:30:56.691
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night;

401
00:30:56.992 --> 00:31:00.439
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

402
00:31:02.325 --> 00:31:06.898
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

403
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:09.732
You have to trick it

404
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:16.697
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

405
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.656
That resolves the problem?

406
00:31:19.908 --> 00:31:21.697
No. But you gain courage to face it

407
00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:27.564
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

408
00:31:45.323 --> 00:31:49.695
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

409
00:31:53.573 --> 00:31:57.613
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

410
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:05.404
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

411
00:32:05.613 --> 00:32:09.358
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

412
00:32:09.572 --> 00:32:13.436
Yell: All is Well...

413
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.730
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

414
00:32:17.322 --> 00:32:20.734
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

415
00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:24.734
No one knows
what the future holds

416
00:32:25.613 --> 00:32:27.354
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

417
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:31.854
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

418
00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:35.943
Hey bro: All is Well

419
00:32:36.696 --> 00:32:40.310
Hey mate: All is Well

420
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:44.316
Hey bro: All is Well

421
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.314
Confusion and more confusion
No sign of any solution

422
00:32:57.528 --> 00:33:01.474
Ah... finally a solution
But wait... what was the question?

423
00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:04.644
If the timid heart with fear
is about to die

424
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:08.727
Then con it bro,
with this simple lie

425
00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:12.644
Heart's an idiot,
it will fall under that spell

426
00:33:13.485 --> 00:33:15.358
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

427
00:33:15.568 --> 00:33:19.692
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

428
00:33:20.902 --> 00:33:24.102
Hey bro: All is Well

429
00:33:24.819 --> 00:33:27.982
Hey mate: All is Well

430
00:33:28.818 --> 00:33:31.899
Hey bro: All is Well

431
00:33:41.484 --> 00:33:45.347
Blew the scholarship on booze
But that did not dispel my blues

432
00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:49.306
Holy incense lit up my plight
And yet God's nowhere in sight

433
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:52.647
The lamb is clueless for
what it's destined

434
00:33:53.442 --> 00:33:56.689
Will it be served on skewers
or simply minced

435
00:33:57.359 --> 00:34:00.725
No one knows
what the future holds

436
00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:03.266
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

437
00:34:03.483 --> 00:34:07.856
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

438
00:34:08.817 --> 00:34:11.731
Hey bro: All is Well

439
00:34:12.775 --> 00:34:15.559
Hey mate: All is Well

440
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.851
Hey bro: All is Well

441
00:34:21.316 --> 00:34:25.310
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

442
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:31.606
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

443
00:34:31.732 --> 00:34:35.312
All is Well

444
00:34:35.523 --> 00:34:38.474
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

445
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.687
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

446
00:34:43.524 --> 00:34:46.475
No one knows
what the future holds

447
00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:49.354
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

448
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.981
Whistle away the toll

449
00:34:51.731 --> 00:34:53.189
Eureka! Eureka;

450
00:34:55.023 --> 00:34:57.891
Yell: All is Well

451
00:34:58.856 --> 00:35:02.019
Hey Mrs. Chicken: All is Well

452
00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:05.854
Hey Mr. Lamb: All is Well

453
00:35:06.855 --> 00:35:09.889
Hey bro: All is Well

454
00:35:10.023 --> 00:35:12.143
Hey, take it up to Joy's window

455
00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:13.892
Take it higher

456
00:35:14.731 --> 00:35:16.388
Look at Silencer: the nude dude;

457
00:35:19.855 --> 00:35:21.396
Joy, come out

458
00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:24.978
Come to the window

459
00:35:25.188 --> 00:35:26.562
Joy, look outside

460
00:36:20.894 --> 00:36:21.759
Good news, sir

461
00:36:23.144 --> 00:36:26.141
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

462
00:36:27.436 --> 00:36:28.762
Everyone thinks this is suicide

463
00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:32.180
The post mortem report -

464
00:36:32.477 --> 00:36:34.800
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

465
00:36:35.018 --> 00:36:36.013
resulting in choking

466
00:36:38.768 --> 00:36:42.714
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

467
00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:47.386
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

468
00:36:48.351 --> 00:36:49.263
That's missing in the report

469
00:36:52.184 --> 00:36:53.890
Engineers are a clever bunch

470
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:58.681
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

471
00:37:01.142 --> 00:37:02.469
If they had, all would know...

472
00:37:03.684 --> 00:37:05.093
this isn't suicide... it's murder

473
00:37:09.434 --> 00:37:13.213
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

474
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:16.932
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

475
00:37:17.391 --> 00:37:21.006
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

476
00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:25.261
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

477
00:37:26.724 --> 00:37:30.884
Look at these statistics -
India ranks N0.1 in suicides

478
00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:34.965
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

479
00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:39.556
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

480
00:37:39.765 --> 00:37:41.093
Something's terribly wrong, sir

481
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:43.470
I can't speak for the rest

482
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.095
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

483
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:48.756
I've run this place for 32 years

484
00:37:49.307 --> 00:37:52.553
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're N0.1

485
00:37:52.724 --> 00:37:54.300
What's the point, sir?

486
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.302
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

487
00:38:01.098 --> 00:38:06.005
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

488
00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:12.212
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

489
00:38:12.389 --> 00:38:14.594
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

490
00:38:15.056 --> 00:38:15.969
No sir, I...

491
00:38:19.223 --> 00:38:20.300
Sir, my paper...

492
00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.293
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

493
00:38:42.055 --> 00:38:43.962
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

494
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:49.134
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

495
00:38:49.846 --> 00:38:54.302
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

496
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.542
We do not have all day

497
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.753
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

498
00:39:56.176 --> 00:39:58.214
You may refer to your books

499
00:39:58.801 --> 00:40:00.839
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

500
00:40:02.134 --> 00:40:05.500
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

501
00:40:06.342 --> 00:40:09.590
Your time starts... now

502
00:40:39.216 --> 00:40:40.129
Time up

503
00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:43.669
Time up, sir

504
00:40:45.549 --> 00:40:47.919
No one got the answer?

505
00:40:50.424 --> 00:40:53.790
Now rewind your life by a minute

506
00:40:55.007 --> 00:40:57.839
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

507
00:40:58.007 --> 00:41:00.756
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

508
00:41:01.549 --> 00:41:03.954
Anyone? ... Sir?

509
00:41:06.882 --> 00:41:09.713
No. You all got into a frantic race

510
00:41:11.756 --> 00:41:13.877
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

511
00:41:16.131 --> 00:41:19.497
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

512
00:41:20.422 --> 00:41:21.963
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

513
00:41:24.173 --> 00:41:27.703
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

514
00:41:28.797 --> 00:41:32.293
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

515
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.328
Hello!

516
00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:38.413
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

517
00:41:38.797 --> 00:41:40.503
Sir, these words don't exist

518
00:41:41.672 --> 00:41:45.002
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

519
00:41:57.546 --> 00:41:58.459
Quiet;

520
00:41:59.963 --> 00:42:02.795
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

521
00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:05.161
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

522
00:42:05.754 --> 00:42:07.247
You're an expert at that

523
00:42:08.087 --> 00:42:11.334
I was teaching you... how to teach

524
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.078
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

525
00:42:17.087 --> 00:42:20.084
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

526
00:42:20.587 --> 00:42:21.581
Bye, sir

527
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.748
Quiet;

528
00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:28.408
Quiet, I said

529
00:42:31.878 --> 00:42:35.243
I regret to inform you
that your son...

530
00:42:35.378 --> 00:42:36.491
Farhan...
Raju...

531
00:42:36.753 --> 00:42:37.830
has fallen into bad company

532
00:42:38.169 --> 00:42:41.333
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined

533
00:42:42.419 --> 00:42:45.701
Virus 's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs

534
00:42:46.002 --> 00:42:48.456
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom

535
00:42:48.544 --> 00:42:51.625
Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down

536
00:42:52.669 --> 00:42:54.825
Come in

537
00:42:57.377 --> 00:42:58.325
See that?

538
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.281
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

539
00:43:04.043 --> 00:43:07.705
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

540
00:43:09.168 --> 00:43:13.114
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

541
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:15.873
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

542
00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:21.499
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. U nderstand?

543
00:43:30.125 --> 00:43:31.499
You took these pictures, Farhan?

544
00:43:33.417 --> 00:43:35.407
He had that useless
obsession for a while

545
00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:38.033
Went around taking
pictures of animals

546
00:43:38.124 --> 00:43:40.909
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

547
00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:44.530
Son, what was your
score that year?

548
00:43:45.499 --> 00:43:46.696
91%

549
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:51.699
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

550
00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:56.290
You find it funny?

551
00:43:56.958 --> 00:44:01.034
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

552
00:44:01.207 --> 00:44:03.826
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

553
00:44:03.999 --> 00:44:05.160
Enough;

554
00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:11.700
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

555
00:44:13.207 --> 00:44:15.577
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

556
00:44:20.498 --> 00:44:22.784
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

557
00:44:25.706 --> 00:44:27.163
Dad denied us a meal...

558
00:44:27.748 --> 00:44:29.406
So, to fill our bellies with food...

559
00:44:29.789 --> 00:44:33.072
and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house

560
00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:39.115
Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film

561
00:44:39.872 --> 00:44:40.867
A small, dingy room...

562
00:44:41.038 --> 00:44:42.532
a paralyzed father...

563
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:44.527
a coughing mother...

564
00:44:44.914 --> 00:44:46.406
and an unwed sister

565
00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:48.913
A sofa sprouting springs...

566
00:44:49.372 --> 00:44:51.658
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof

567
00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:55.944
Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer

568
00:44:56.622 --> 00:44:58.778
Father was once a postmaster

569
00:44:59.288 --> 00:45:01.693
Paralysis shut down
his body partly...

570
00:45:02.163 --> 00:45:04.568
his salary completely.
And the sister...

571
00:45:04.746 --> 00:45:08.360
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

572
00:45:08.996 --> 00:45:11.614
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

573
00:45:12.121 --> 00:45:13.033
Some okra?

574
00:45:14.038 --> 00:45:17.901
Okra is now 12 /- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

575
00:45:18.245 --> 00:45:19.655
It's daylight robbery;

576
00:45:20.037 --> 00:45:24.031
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

577
00:45:24.287 --> 00:45:25.199
Mom!

578
00:45:26.787 --> 00:45:27.734
Cottage cheese?

579
00:45:28.204 --> 00:45:31.735
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

580
00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:33.826
Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's ok

581
00:45:34.494 --> 00:45:36.036
Mom, please

582
00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:38.701
Alright, I'll shut up

583
00:45:40.369 --> 00:45:44.861
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

584
00:45:45.077 --> 00:45:47.364
and then take the vow of silence

585
00:45:48.327 --> 00:45:52.866
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes: his friends?

586
00:45:56.786 --> 00:45:57.863
Hey Raju

587
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.441
We were in a huge dilemma

588
00:46:03.076 --> 00:46:06.193
Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?

589
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.361
Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese

590
00:46:22.284 --> 00:46:25.117
Even his eczema cream
costs 55 /- now

591
00:46:29.867 --> 00:46:31.195
Another roti?

592
00:46:31.533 --> 00:46:34.484
No, thank you. We're through

593
00:46:42.284 --> 00:46:44.855
Okra for 12 /-
- Cauliflower for 10 /-

594
00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:49.733
At least you were offered a meal

595
00:46:50.575 --> 00:46:53.442
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi;

596
00:46:53.575 --> 00:46:56.276
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

597
00:46:56.532 --> 00:47:00.112
Don't poke fun at my mom;
- Enough, you guys

598
00:47:00.408 --> 00:47:01.817
I'm famished. Let's eat out

599
00:47:01.949 --> 00:47:04.319
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

600
00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:09.939
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

601
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.399
C'mon
- Come

602
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.230
Good evening,
good evening

603
00:47:18.324 --> 00:47:19.189
Oh, U ncle

604
00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.736
Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water

605
00:47:27.948 --> 00:47:29.192
If we're caught, we're dead

606
00:47:29.364 --> 00:47:31.900
What's for starters?
- Get double portions

607
00:47:31.989 --> 00:47:35.023
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

608
00:47:35.781 --> 00:47:37.440
Pia, what the hell!

609
00:47:37.823 --> 00:47:40.525
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

610
00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:45.318
What'll people say: My fiancee...

611
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:48.309
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200 /- watch;

612
00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:50.731
Please take it off. Thank you

613
00:47:51.281 --> 00:47:52.311
Hi handsome

614
00:47:52.447 --> 00:47:55.279
Hey Aunty.
You're looking good

615
00:47:55.364 --> 00:47:57.934
Don't miss my set, darling
- Rubies?

616
00:47:58.114 --> 00:48:00.732
From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow;

617
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:03.524
Hey, let's go meet David
- Of course

618
00:48:06.696 --> 00:48:07.775
Excuse me

619
00:48:09.947 --> 00:48:11.108
Yes?

620
00:48:11.404 --> 00:48:12.483
Flowers

621
00:48:13.988 --> 00:48:17.188
May I take the glass?
- Why?

622
00:48:17.488 --> 00:48:19.774
So you don't break it on my head

623
00:48:20.571 --> 00:48:21.815
Why would I do that?

624
00:48:22.237 --> 00:48:24.358
For the free advice I'll now impart

625
00:48:25.529 --> 00:48:26.394
What?

626
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.313
Don't marry that ass

627
00:48:29.403 --> 00:48:30.317
Excuse me?

628
00:48:30.529 --> 00:48:32.235
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

629
00:48:32.654 --> 00:48:35.652
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

630
00:48:36.278 --> 00:48:38.849
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

631
00:48:39.153 --> 00:48:40.018
Want a demonstration?

632
00:48:42.194 --> 00:48:43.818
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

633
00:48:45.362 --> 00:48:47.269
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

634
00:48:59.319 --> 00:49:05.268
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

635
00:49:05.402 --> 00:49:08.602
Run for your life;
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

636
00:49:09.152 --> 00:49:11.854
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched;

637
00:49:16.444 --> 00:49:19.145
Dad, are they your guests?

638
00:49:22.485 --> 00:49:25.767
My students.
What're they doing here?

639
00:49:29.734 --> 00:49:30.931
Hold on, Dad

640
00:49:32.484 --> 00:49:34.724
These beans smell great

641
00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:37.182
No room for roti
- Just pile it on

642
00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:40.525
Hi
- Hey

643
00:49:42.067 --> 00:49:45.065
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

644
00:49:46.567 --> 00:49:48.853
It was my moral responsibility

645
00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.059
Can I ask you for little more help?

646
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:54.769
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

647
00:49:55.734 --> 00:49:59.727
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

648
00:50:00.025 --> 00:50:02.644
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce

649
00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:04.648
You're really sweet

650
00:50:05.858 --> 00:50:08.939
Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you

651
00:50:13.565 --> 00:50:15.889
Aal izz well

652
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:21.846
Run for your life;
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

653
00:50:22.149 --> 00:50:23.689
What're you doing here?

654
00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:27.432
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

655
00:50:28.482 --> 00:50:30.768
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

656
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:32.352
Sister?

657
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:37.596
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

658
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:40.054
Empty. No gift cheques

659
00:50:40.398 --> 00:50:42.472
Forgot the cheques, Raju
...Farhan?

660
00:50:42.564 --> 00:50:46.724
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

661
00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:51.176
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

662
00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:53.518
How? Can you explain?

663
00:50:53.772 --> 00:50:57.433
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

664
00:50:57.731 --> 00:50:58.678
Won't you?

665
00:50:59.522 --> 00:51:03.102
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

666
00:51:03.356 --> 00:51:05.678
disrupt wedding celebrations

667
00:51:06.022 --> 00:51:08.142
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

668
00:51:08.272 --> 00:51:10.677
draws power from guests' cars

669
00:51:10.897 --> 00:51:12.271
I see

670
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.973
Wow

671
00:51:14.355 --> 00:51:15.765
So where's the inverter?

672
00:51:16.563 --> 00:51:18.186
Sir, the design is ready

673
00:51:21.271 --> 00:51:22.551
Where's the design, Farhan?

674
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.013
I gave you the design
- I gave it to Raju

675
00:51:26.438 --> 00:51:27.386
Raju, design?

676
00:51:30.479 --> 00:51:34.224
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

677
00:51:34.562 --> 00:51:38.223
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

678
00:51:38.521 --> 00:51:41.602
I'll make one, I promise

679
00:51:41.937 --> 00:51:45.433
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

680
00:51:45.853 --> 00:51:49.349
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

681
00:51:49.479 --> 00:51:55.511
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

682
00:52:01.394 --> 00:52:04.890
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

683
00:52:05.228 --> 00:52:06.886
...in installments

684
00:52:09.352 --> 00:52:12.600
We'll never crash a wedding again
- Not even my own

685
00:52:12.728 --> 00:52:14.967
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

686
00:52:15.644 --> 00:52:17.681
Uh... right. No marriage

687
00:52:19.186 --> 00:52:21.555
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

688
00:52:23.227 --> 00:52:25.762
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

689
00:52:28.268 --> 00:52:29.298
Sit!

690
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:41.339
Pay attention

691
00:52:52.267 --> 00:52:57.220
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

692
00:52:58.558 --> 00:53:04.887
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income

693
00:53:07.433 --> 00:53:13.762
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

694
00:53:15.016 --> 00:53:18.382
Isn't that your father's income,
Farhan?

695
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:20.972
Yes, sir

696
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:24.387
Now take away another zero...

697
00:53:27.432 --> 00:53:31.212
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

698
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:33.764
Big reason to worry

699
00:53:38.474 --> 00:53:45.631
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

700
00:53:46.057 --> 00:53:50.299
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

701
00:54:12.222 --> 00:54:14.627
Want a shave?
- No, sir

702
00:54:14.805 --> 00:54:15.670
Then get lost!

703
00:54:26.929 --> 00:54:32.511
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

704
00:54:32.638 --> 00:54:33.715
I have to worry

705
00:54:34.138 --> 00:54:37.633
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

706
00:54:38.554 --> 00:54:41.587
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

707
00:54:41.721 --> 00:54:43.592
Shut up, Raju

708
00:54:43.846 --> 00:54:46.512
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

709
00:54:46.888 --> 00:54:48.344
I won't be his flunky... like you

710
00:54:49.303 --> 00:54:51.591
You're crossing the line
- No, I'm drawing one

711
00:54:52.096 --> 00:54:53.802
I have a family to support

712
00:54:56.012 --> 00:54:58.252
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

713
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:04.592
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

714
00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:11.754
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

715
00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:17.794
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

716
00:55:18.928 --> 00:55:20.918
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

717
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:23.254
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

718
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:28.253
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

719
00:55:28.927 --> 00:55:33.251
To quote a Wise One: Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

720
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:39.544
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down;

721
00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.378
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

722
00:55:45.427 --> 00:55:46.421
Go rot in the bogs;

723
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:51.048
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

724
00:55:51.343 --> 00:55:52.504
Oh yeah?

725
00:55:56.176 --> 00:55:58.296
Shove this back into the tube

726
00:56:01.343 --> 00:56:02.965
Raju got onto another train

727
00:56:03.508 --> 00:56:08.664
His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels

728
00:56:13.092 --> 00:56:14.999
Chatur was called 'Silencer'

729
00:56:15.341 --> 00:56:19.039
To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack

730
00:56:19.466 --> 00:56:21.421
And then let off silent...
but lethal farts

731
00:56:24.132 --> 00:56:27.333
I didn't do it... Raju?

732
00:56:27.508 --> 00:56:30.174
He always blamed others
for the output

733
00:56:30.924 --> 00:56:33.792
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day

734
00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:37.166
On exam eve,
he would distract others

735
00:56:41.132 --> 00:56:44.213
His belief: There are only
two ways of topping

736
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:47.831
Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades

737
00:56:52.131 --> 00:56:55.996
Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...

738
00:56:56.465 --> 00:56:57.744
with one master plan

739
00:56:59.798 --> 00:57:07.797
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

740
00:57:07.881 --> 00:57:11.921
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

741
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.953
Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function

742
00:57:17.297 --> 00:57:21.207
To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...

743
00:57:21.422 --> 00:57:22.750
in highbrow Hindi

744
00:57:24.297 --> 00:57:29.666
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

745
00:57:30.047 --> 00:57:32.452
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

746
00:57:33.838 --> 00:57:37.120
Oh... the things I have to do...

747
00:57:40.713 --> 00:57:43.877
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

748
00:57:44.005 --> 00:57:45.581
Really?
- Yes. Just now

749
00:57:45.963 --> 00:57:49.328
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

750
00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:57.538
Hello. Hello
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

751
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:58.582
Yes?

752
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:01.540
I'm calling from the police station

753
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.753
Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

754
00:58:06.295 --> 00:58:09.328
Your life is in danger
- What? ... How?

755
00:58:10.461 --> 00:58:12.251
Listen carefully, or else...

756
00:58:12.878 --> 00:58:17.203
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

757
00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.204
Why? What happened?

758
00:58:19.336 --> 00:58:20.912
While Chatur was kept engaged

759
00:58:21.336 --> 00:58:25.330
Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for eg...

760
00:58:25.544 --> 00:58:27.914
'served' became 'screwed'

761
00:58:28.752 --> 00:58:30.032
Yes sir?

762
00:58:30.586 --> 00:58:33.121
Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

763
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:36.872
I'm permanent staff, sir

764
00:58:37.502 --> 00:58:38.912
Congratulations

765
00:58:39.335 --> 00:58:42.701
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

766
00:58:43.085 --> 00:58:44.033
Excuse me, sir

767
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.950
Yes... so where was I?

768
00:58:56.209 --> 00:58:58.615
You said I may die...
outside the gate

769
00:58:58.751 --> 00:59:05.162
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

770
00:59:05.376 --> 00:59:07.413
Traffic signal. Ok

771
00:59:07.625 --> 00:59:13.160
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

772
00:59:13.667 --> 00:59:14.995
Ok. Then?

773
00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:17.116
Then cross the road
with great caution

774
00:59:17.875 --> 00:59:23.112
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

775
00:59:25.042 --> 00:59:26.867
What nonsense! I know that

776
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.579
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

777
00:59:37.625 --> 00:59:39.698
From the librarian, Silencer

778
00:59:39.833 --> 00:59:41.409
You don't call me that,
Chanchad

779
00:59:47.249 --> 00:59:49.323
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

780
00:59:50.124 --> 00:59:52.363
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

781
00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.111
Remembered?
Rascals;

782
01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:05.321
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

783
01:00:07.623 --> 01:00:11.912
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

784
01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:16.486
respected teachers and friends

785
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:22.951
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

786
01:00:23.581 --> 01:00:27.870
The credit goes solely to

787
01:00:28.288 --> 01:00:32.069
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

788
01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:36.246
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

789
01:00:36.997 --> 01:00:39.236
He's a great guy, really you are

790
01:00:40.997 --> 01:00:48.900
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

791
01:00:51.455 --> 01:00:53.824
He means: 'served' students

792
01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:56.650
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

793
01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:04.366
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

794
01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.494
can screw so many, so well

795
01:01:10.578 --> 01:01:15.864
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

796
01:01:19.579 --> 01:01:26.191
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

797
01:01:28.787 --> 01:01:30.528
Let's replicate his methods

798
01:01:34.328 --> 01:01:39.992
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

799
01:01:40.661 --> 01:01:46.858
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

800
01:01:50.911 --> 01:01:54.110
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

801
01:01:59.702 --> 01:02:04.489
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

802
01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:06.817
cannot be matched by any student...

803
01:02:07.076 --> 01:02:10.607
anywhere on the planet

804
01:02:18.325 --> 01:02:21.359
Mr. Minister. Good evening

805
01:02:21.951 --> 01:02:29.439
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

806
01:02:30.201 --> 01:02:31.823
Booty, funds
- Bosom

807
01:02:35.409 --> 01:02:37.564
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

808
01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:41.029
What nonsense! That's insulting

809
01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:46.196
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

810
01:02:47.783 --> 01:02:49.773
No one offers it so readily

811
01:02:53.782 --> 01:02:54.730
Vulgar fellow;

812
01:02:54.907 --> 01:02:56.530
You have generously offered
your bosom...

813
01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.988
to this relentless screwer

814
01:03:02.949 --> 01:03:07.191
Now see how he makes it grow

815
01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:11.691
Is this what you teach here, Director?

816
01:03:19.364 --> 01:03:22.777
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

817
01:03:22.906 --> 01:03:25.904
Listen to this: the might
of his fart in verse

818
01:03:26.448 --> 01:03:28.983
A good loud fart is honorable

819
01:03:29.198 --> 01:03:31.567
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

820
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.607
A medium fart is tolerable

821
01:03:37.905 --> 01:03:41.484
Softer windbreaks are terrible

822
01:03:44.447 --> 01:03:49.353
And the silent ones unbearable

823
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.231
What did I do?

824
01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:02.438
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

825
01:04:02.613 --> 01:04:06.108
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

826
01:04:06.362 --> 01:04:10.191
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

827
01:04:11.404 --> 01:04:14.023
He still doesn't get it

828
01:04:20.154 --> 01:04:24.527
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable;

829
01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:27.445
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

830
01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:32.274
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

831
01:04:34.778 --> 01:04:38.108
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

832
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:43.107
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

833
01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:44.604
I will

834
01:04:45.194 --> 01:04:48.061
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

835
01:04:48.694 --> 01:04:52.558
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

836
01:04:52.861 --> 01:04:58.230
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju: Don't cram blindly

837
01:04:58.568 --> 01:05:00.772
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

838
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:03.391
I'm not here to enjoy Science

839
01:05:03.527 --> 01:05:06.442
So You're here to screw Science

840
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.108
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods

841
01:05:12.193 --> 01:05:16.517
But one day these methods
will bring me success

842
01:05:16.984 --> 01:05:19.852
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

843
01:05:21.276 --> 01:05:25.518
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

844
01:05:26.401 --> 01:05:28.605
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

845
01:05:28.818 --> 01:05:33.439
These ideals don't work
in the real world

846
01:05:34.275 --> 01:05:38.269
You take your train, I'll take mine

847
01:05:39.067 --> 01:05:42.349
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

848
01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:48.186
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

849
01:05:48.483 --> 01:05:50.888
you... or I

850
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:55.975
Have the balls? C'mon, bet;

851
01:05:56.191 --> 01:05:59.771
It's a challenge

852
01:06:01.066 --> 01:06:01.979
Watch it!

853
01:06:08.607 --> 01:06:09.520
What's he writing?

854
01:06:17.148 --> 01:06:19.435
Don't forget this date

855
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:30.302
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

856
01:06:30.648 --> 01:06:31.891
Get used to them, Pia

857
01:06:32.023 --> 01:06:34.144
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

858
01:06:34.273 --> 01:06:35.386
Where's the bill, man?

859
01:06:39.856 --> 01:06:40.768
I'll be back

860
01:06:51.147 --> 01:06:52.805
You changed the speech?
- What?

861
01:06:52.896 --> 01:06:53.761
Don't lie

862
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.352
Um... Yeah

863
01:06:56.563 --> 01:06:58.969
What's your problem with dad?
- I have no problem

864
01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:02.271
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

865
01:07:06.604 --> 01:07:08.098
Why're you harassing him?

866
01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.389
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

867
01:07:10.646 --> 01:07:14.343
Churning out asses.
Like that one

868
01:07:19.479 --> 01:07:20.510
She destroyed it, man

869
01:07:23.895 --> 01:07:25.140
How dare you call him an ass?

870
01:07:25.354 --> 01:07:28.636
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

871
01:07:28.771 --> 01:07:30.559
then becomes a banker in the USA

872
01:07:31.478 --> 01:07:33.967
Because it rakes in
more money?

873
01:07:34.228 --> 01:07:36.763
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

874
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.010
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

875
01:07:39.354 --> 01:07:43.015
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

876
01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:44.591
It's not you he cares for

877
01:07:46.853 --> 01:07:48.227
Who do you think you are?

878
01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:50.137
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

879
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:54.052
New watch? One moment

880
01:07:55.269 --> 01:07:57.343
You always need a demo

881
01:07:58.394 --> 01:07:59.223
Hey Suhas

882
01:08:01.394 --> 01:08:02.970
Where were you?

883
01:08:03.394 --> 01:08:05.052
She's looking for her watch

884
01:08:05.227 --> 01:08:07.017
What? You lost the watch

885
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:08.430
Never mind. Get another

886
01:08:08.727 --> 01:08:10.006
It cost 400,000;

887
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.016
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time

888
01:08:14.185 --> 01:08:16.508
How could you be so careless, Pia

889
01:08:16.685 --> 01:08:19.801
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

890
01:08:19.935 --> 01:08:22.506
That was a limited edition watch

891
01:08:22.892 --> 01:08:26.341
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

892
01:08:27.684 --> 01:08:29.094
What're you staring at?

893
01:08:32.059 --> 01:08:34.808
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

894
01:08:35.351 --> 01:08:36.595
I can't handle this

895
01:08:37.434 --> 01:08:39.554
Stop crying and look for it

896
01:08:53.058 --> 01:08:55.973
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass;

897
01:09:02.391 --> 01:09:05.057
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

898
01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.173
Get lost

899
01:09:06.974 --> 01:09:08.135
It's too noisy here

900
01:09:08.474 --> 01:09:10.381
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

901
01:09:10.557 --> 01:09:13.390
I said 'Get lost'
- Don't get so uptight

902
01:09:13.766 --> 01:09:16.515
Actually, you never
really loved him

903
01:09:16.932 --> 01:09:17.796
What do you mean?

904
01:09:18.182 --> 01:09:22.969
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

905
01:09:24.515 --> 01:09:26.138
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

906
01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.882
The Moon appears gigantic?

907
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.960
That happens in movies, not in life

908
01:09:32.098 --> 01:09:35.132
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

909
01:09:35.473 --> 01:09:36.551
...not an ass

910
01:09:41.931 --> 01:09:46.588
Hello. What?

911
01:09:47.681 --> 01:09:51.177
Oh God; Ok, I'm on my way

912
01:09:54.389 --> 01:09:56.297
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

913
01:09:56.389 --> 01:09:58.095
It's an emergency, please
- What?

914
01:09:58.597 --> 01:10:01.797
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

915
01:10:02.014 --> 01:10:04.680
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

916
01:10:05.347 --> 01:10:07.172
Please help me,
it's an emergency

917
01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.843
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

918
01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:17.591
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

919
01:10:18.096 --> 01:10:19.672
and here I am, helping you;

920
01:10:20.805 --> 01:10:22.002
Unbelievable;

921
01:10:23.179 --> 01:10:27.042
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

922
01:10:31.887 --> 01:10:33.795
Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab

923
01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:35.671
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

924
01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.541
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

925
01:10:38.762 --> 01:10:39.675
but an ambulance...;

926
01:10:39.929 --> 01:10:42.215
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

927
01:10:56.344 --> 01:10:57.375
Hey stop;

928
01:10:59.678 --> 01:11:01.917
Move, it's an emergency!

929
01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:04.666
Move... move...

930
01:11:06.636 --> 01:11:07.714
Move... move...

931
01:11:11.761 --> 01:11:13.916
Doctor, emergency!

932
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:16.423
That's the patient

933
01:11:22.385 --> 01:11:24.459
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

934
01:11:24.969 --> 01:11:26.876
What the hell;
You brought dad on the scooter

935
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.086
Should I've sent him by courier?

936
01:11:30.468 --> 01:11:33.300
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

937
01:11:33.885 --> 01:11:35.709
Go ask the doctor

938
01:11:36.676 --> 01:11:39.923
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

939
01:11:40.301 --> 01:11:43.050
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

940
01:11:43.217 --> 01:11:44.960
Call me if there's a problem

941
01:11:53.884 --> 01:11:56.882
Rancho; Thank you...

942
01:11:58.634 --> 01:12:01.667
Thanking your buddies;
Silencer teaching you manners?

943
01:12:02.884 --> 01:12:05.965
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

944
01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:10.672
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

945
01:12:11.257 --> 01:12:14.505
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

946
01:12:16.174 --> 01:12:18.461
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

947
01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:20.039
Don't worry

948
01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:31.249
Rancho, forgive me.
I was scared

949
01:12:31.507 --> 01:12:33.628
It's ok. Quiet, now

950
01:12:36.174 --> 01:12:38.330
Please forgive me

951
01:12:44.924 --> 01:12:48.964
It's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad

952
01:12:49.506 --> 01:12:50.880
And don't go
with that weepy face

953
01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.168
Thanks buddy

954
01:13:09.755 --> 01:13:14.543
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

955
01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:17.161
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

956
01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:21.704
Hey, happy Independence Day

957
01:13:21.963 --> 01:13:23.669
Today isn't Independence Day

958
01:13:24.005 --> 01:13:27.168
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

959
01:13:27.797 --> 01:13:30.546
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

960
01:13:32.837 --> 01:13:33.702
Hey

961
01:13:35.671 --> 01:13:37.662
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

962
01:13:39.421 --> 01:13:41.874
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

963
01:13:42.671 --> 01:13:43.868
Only the watch was old

964
01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:45.417
What could that mean?

965
01:13:47.711 --> 01:13:50.875
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

966
01:13:53.712 --> 01:13:54.742
Yes

967
01:13:55.795 --> 01:13:57.536
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

968
01:14:00.087 --> 01:14:02.243
Yes. How do you know?

969
01:14:02.503 --> 01:14:03.498
Seen your dad?

970
01:14:05.045 --> 01:14:06.703
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

971
01:14:06.878 --> 01:14:08.501
you'll be a broken egg
...cuckoo bird'

972
01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.867
You...

973
01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:19.789
The winds whisper a melody

974
01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.744
The sky hums along

975
01:14:28.335 --> 01:14:34.249
Time itself is singing...

976
01:14:35.293 --> 01:14:38.825
Zoobi do...

977
01:14:39.585 --> 01:14:44.159
Param pum

978
01:14:45.793 --> 01:14:50.497
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

979
01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:55.783
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

980
01:14:56.459 --> 01:15:01.495
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

981
01:15:01.834 --> 01:15:06.491
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

982
01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:11.905
Leaves sing on their branches
Bees jam with flowers

983
01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:17.031
Crazy sunbeams dance off petals
As birds yodel in the skies

984
01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:22.531
Flowers, bold and brazen
Snuggle and cootchie-coo

985
01:15:22.999 --> 01:15:27.574
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

986
01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:33.198
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

987
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:38.412
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

988
01:15:39.332 --> 01:15:44.073
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

989
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:49.529
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

990
01:15:52.706 --> 01:15:55.740
Let's make the unique and
ever useful mint sauce

991
01:15:56.164 --> 01:16:01.533
The all-powerful sauce that
exposes phony people

992
01:16:02.456 --> 01:16:04.779
Your 7th house is clear

993
01:16:05.289 --> 01:16:07.446
Shunning an ass,
you 'll fall for a human

994
01:16:07.956 --> 01:16:09.663
Time is ripe for love

995
01:16:14.455 --> 01:16:16.410
Temperature in New Delhi
remains stable

996
01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:20.864
Clear skies.
But if in love, expect rain

997
01:16:26.497 --> 01:16:31.119
Pitter-patter go the raindrops
Whish-whoosh whistles the wind

998
01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:36.658
Do-da-dee waltzes the rain
Boom-boom echoes the sky

999
01:16:36.954 --> 01:16:42.026
Drenched in rain and passion
You sway your hips on cue

1000
01:16:42.246 --> 01:16:47.033
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1001
01:16:47.912 --> 01:16:52.487
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1002
01:16:53.328 --> 01:16:57.737
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1003
01:16:58.495 --> 01:17:03.236
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1004
01:17:03.954 --> 01:17:08.776
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1005
01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:35.026
The gorgeous low moon
Serenades the earth

1006
01:17:35.536 --> 01:17:40.607
A shooting star skips along
Crooning a ballad of love

1007
01:17:41.118 --> 01:17:45.989
The night is bright but lonesome
Come touch me, my handsome

1008
01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:51.191
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1009
01:17:52.076 --> 01:17:56.615
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1010
01:17:57.159 --> 01:18:01.982
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1011
01:18:02.659 --> 01:18:07.115
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1012
01:18:07.784 --> 01:18:12.737
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1013
01:18:13.283 --> 01:18:17.656
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1014
01:18:18.575 --> 01:18:26.527
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1015
01:18:33.158 --> 01:18:34.402
Hello. Wake up

1016
01:18:35.325 --> 01:18:37.943
Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What;

1017
01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:39.525
No, stupid

1018
01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:42.272
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1019
01:18:42.949 --> 01:18:45.319
But we can't leave him alone

1020
01:18:45.657 --> 01:18:48.442
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1021
01:18:48.532 --> 01:18:51.198
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1022
01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:52.687
Hey...

1023
01:18:57.111 --> 01:18:58.485
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1024
01:19:05.028 --> 01:19:05.975
Go

1025
01:19:24.068 --> 01:19:26.473
Sorry, we're late
- It was an emergency

1026
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.473
Settle down there

1027
01:19:38.026 --> 01:19:39.269
Sir, they're still writing

1028
01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:42.315
Hello. Time up

1029
01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:45.769
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1030
01:19:45.942 --> 01:19:47.139
It was an emergency

1031
01:19:47.234 --> 01:19:51.523
He glared at us like we 'd
asked for both his kidneys

1032
01:19:52.734 --> 01:19:53.895
But we continued writing

1033
01:19:54.858 --> 01:19:57.892
He continued arranging
the answer sheets

1034
01:20:06.399 --> 01:20:07.312
Done, sir

1035
01:20:08.316 --> 01:20:10.935
You're late.
I can't accept these

1036
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:12.013
Sir, please, sir

1037
01:20:16.565 --> 01:20:17.892
Sir, do you know who we are?

1038
01:20:19.358 --> 01:20:21.182
Prime Ministers son?
Even then...

1039
01:20:21.482 --> 01:20:23.556
I will not accept your paper

1040
01:20:25.065 --> 01:20:27.056
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1041
01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:29.470
No...

1042
01:20:31.315 --> 01:20:32.345
Who are you?

1043
01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.431
He doesn't know: Run!

1044
01:20:36.106 --> 01:20:38.393
Hey, what's your roll number?

1045
01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:43.479
Where the hell are their papers?

1046
01:20:47.981 --> 01:20:49.806
O Lord, have mercy

1047
01:20:49.898 --> 01:20:55.680
Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God

1048
01:20:55.814 --> 01:20:58.302
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1049
01:20:58.772 --> 01:21:03.678
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1050
01:21:03.897 --> 01:21:07.309
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1051
01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:10.893
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1052
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:12.645
Watch over my results

1053
01:21:12.855 --> 01:21:16.718
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100 /-
every month

1054
01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:19.556
100 /- won't bribe even a traffic cop

1055
01:21:20.271 --> 01:21:22.097
let alone the Almighty

1056
01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:25.386
Check from the bottom

1057
01:21:26.397 --> 01:21:28.517
You are... last

1058
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:31.142
And you?

1059
01:21:33.187 --> 01:21:34.644
Second last

1060
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:37.306
Rancho?

1061
01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:42.807
Not there

1062
01:21:44.187 --> 01:21:45.217
My heart sank

1063
01:21:45.812 --> 01:21:50.220
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1064
01:21:52.687 --> 01:21:56.383
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1065
01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.434
What's Silencer howling about?

1066
01:22:04.061 --> 01:22:05.009
He got the second rank

1067
01:22:06.935 --> 01:22:08.393
Who's first?

1068
01:22:09.602 --> 01:22:10.716
Rancho

1069
01:22:13.227 --> 01:22:14.471
Rancho?

1070
01:22:16.935 --> 01:22:17.765
Move aside

1071
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.847
We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:

1072
01:22:25.644 --> 01:22:31.012
Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse

1073
01:22:31.726 --> 01:22:36.134
We were sad.
Two others were sadder

1074
01:22:37.393 --> 01:22:41.257
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1075
01:22:41.893 --> 01:22:44.179
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1076
01:22:45.101 --> 01:22:48.348
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1077
01:22:50.142 --> 01:22:52.808
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1078
01:22:52.976 --> 01:22:55.428
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1079
01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.844
Any problem with that?

1080
01:22:57.975 --> 01:23:02.099
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1081
01:23:02.558 --> 01:23:05.722
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1082
01:23:06.017 --> 01:23:09.299
It's not nice, sir
- You have a better idea?

1083
01:23:09.892 --> 01:23:14.050
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1084
01:23:14.516 --> 01:23:18.593
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1085
01:23:18.891 --> 01:23:23.928
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1086
01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:25.514
or air your report on TV

1087
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:27.427
You see, sir?

1088
01:23:28.016 --> 01:23:29.806
So basically,
what you are saying is

1089
01:23:30.307 --> 01:23:32.097
I should personally go to
each student's room

1090
01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.218
and whisper in his ears...

1091
01:23:35.265 --> 01:23:37.670
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1092
01:23:37.766 --> 01:23:39.342
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1093
01:23:42.348 --> 01:23:46.721
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1094
01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:51.012
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1095
01:23:51.265 --> 01:23:53.669
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1096
01:23:53.848 --> 01:23:55.389
At least they're in the corner

1097
01:23:55.515 --> 01:23:57.919
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1098
01:23:59.055 --> 01:24:01.046
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1099
01:24:01.848 --> 01:24:05.711
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1100
01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:08.005
prefers humans to machines

1101
01:24:09.888 --> 01:24:11.714
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1102
01:24:13.722 --> 01:24:16.044
You guarantee it;

1103
01:24:16.264 --> 01:24:17.804
Bet, sir?

1104
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.507
Govind
- Yes, sir?

1105
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.962
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1106
01:24:31.179 --> 01:24:32.376
shave off my moustache

1107
01:24:35.138 --> 01:24:36.003
Sir!

1108
01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:39.337
Happy?
- Smile, please

1109
01:24:40.637 --> 01:24:41.585
Happy, sir

1110
01:24:46.554 --> 01:24:49.552
Jackass;
Honking to hide your tooting

1111
01:24:50.095 --> 01:24:52.797
Septic tank; Popping pills again?

1112
01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:55.720
I didn't do it... Raju?

1113
01:24:55.928 --> 01:24:57.551
This is a familiar stink

1114
01:24:57.637 --> 01:25:00.670
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1115
01:25:25.927 --> 01:25:28.545
Toss me your wallet: I'll buy pants

1116
01:25:29.135 --> 01:25:33.295
Take Chatur's suit instead
- Don't touch my suit

1117
01:25:34.468 --> 01:25:36.258
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1118
01:25:36.426 --> 01:25:40.420
Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1119
01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:43.206
He can't read
- But he can speak

1120
01:25:43.426 --> 01:25:47.420
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1121
01:25:47.635 --> 01:25:49.376
Yes, he lives there

1122
01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:55.384
Free as the wind was he

1123
01:25:57.384 --> 01:26:02.799
Like a soaring kite was he

1124
01:26:04.467 --> 01:26:06.754
Where did he go...

1125
01:26:06.967 --> 01:26:09.206
let's find him

1126
01:26:09.342 --> 01:26:12.008
Chatur, your pills
- Thanks. Where were they?

1127
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:14.585
In the pocket
- Hey, my pants!

1128
01:26:14.717 --> 01:26:16.708
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1129
01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:20.255
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1130
01:26:21.799 --> 01:26:22.830
I want it now

1131
01:26:38.091 --> 01:26:39.204
What happened?

1132
01:26:41.341 --> 01:26:42.538
Rancho's father

1133
01:26:46.049 --> 01:26:48.798
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

1134
01:26:49.632 --> 01:26:52.037
There he is
- Thank you

1135
01:27:15.214 --> 01:27:18.377
Rancho...
- Yes?

1136
01:27:18.963 --> 01:27:22.661
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1137
01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:24.999
I am Ranchhoddas

1138
01:27:25.589 --> 01:27:29.499
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1139
01:27:30.921 --> 01:27:33.492
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1140
01:27:38.963 --> 01:27:41.249
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1141
01:28:00.545 --> 01:28:02.666
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1142
01:28:09.837 --> 01:28:10.866
Raju

1143
01:28:36.127 --> 01:28:39.742
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1144
01:28:39.877 --> 01:28:40.991
That too, for the wrong guy;

1145
01:28:41.502 --> 01:28:45.448
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1146
01:28:46.002 --> 01:28:47.494
What's going on?

1147
01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:50.876
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1148
01:28:52.043 --> 01:28:52.907
Good point!

1149
01:28:54.335 --> 01:28:55.744
Hey Chatur, come here

1150
01:29:02.043 --> 01:29:05.539
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1151
01:29:05.584 --> 01:29:07.125
Handmade biscuits

1152
01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:11.204
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1153
01:29:11.459 --> 01:29:13.615
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1154
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:18.282
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1155
01:29:18.417 --> 01:29:21.249
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1156
01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:24.035
400 patents.
The world wants him

1157
01:29:25.083 --> 01:29:28.531
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1158
01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:34.742
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1159
01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:38.992
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1160
01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:41.080
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1161
01:29:41.458 --> 01:29:45.036
He led me to Rancho, See this

1162
01:29:47.207 --> 01:29:51.616
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1163
01:29:51.748 --> 01:29:56.073
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1164
01:29:56.207 --> 01:30:01.824
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1165
01:30:01.873 --> 01:30:03.532
What happened to his face?

1166
01:30:03.915 --> 01:30:06.201
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1167
01:30:10.623 --> 01:30:12.447
Only one man has the answer

1168
01:30:13.039 --> 01:30:17.661
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1169
01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:22.945
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1170
01:30:23.872 --> 01:30:26.360
But I waited
for the highway tender

1171
01:30:27.872 --> 01:30:32.329
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1172
01:30:36.413 --> 01:30:40.905
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1173
01:30:41.079 --> 01:30:42.407
Wrong

1174
01:30:42.871 --> 01:30:45.704
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1175
01:30:45.996 --> 01:30:47.276
You were a very good son

1176
01:30:49.913 --> 01:30:54.654
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1177
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:58.029
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries

1178
01:30:58.288 --> 01:31:01.404
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1179
01:31:01.871 --> 01:31:05.117
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1180
01:31:20.703 --> 01:31:22.113
This is a 150 acre estate

1181
01:31:22.536 --> 01:31:25.736
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1182
01:31:26.078 --> 01:31:26.990
Get the point?

1183
01:31:28.328 --> 01:31:29.193
Now get lost

1184
01:31:34.744 --> 01:31:39.069
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1185
01:31:46.536 --> 01:31:48.112
Grab Papa!

1186
01:31:51.036 --> 01:31:52.149
Here, here

1187
01:31:56.285 --> 01:31:57.315
Let go of Papa;

1188
01:32:00.244 --> 01:32:03.075
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed;

1189
01:32:03.201 --> 01:32:06.116
Hand over Papa
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1190
01:32:06.827 --> 01:32:10.157
Get Papa out of the potty
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1191
01:32:10.285 --> 01:32:11.611
I'll count to three

1192
01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.356
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1193
01:32:18.075 --> 01:32:19.070
One

1194
01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:23.983
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1195
01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:26.155
Two

1196
01:32:26.242 --> 01:32:28.695
Then grope for him in the gutter

1197
01:32:28.826 --> 01:32:29.690
What is it, Raju?

1198
01:32:31.116 --> 01:32:33.606
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty;

1199
01:32:34.492 --> 01:32:35.404
Empty?

1200
01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:40.231
Empty: we'll empty it out;

1201
01:32:40.367 --> 01:32:41.231
No, no;

1202
01:32:41.325 --> 01:32:44.192
We'll empty it out

1203
01:32:44.283 --> 01:32:46.736
No... hands up!

1204
01:32:49.033 --> 01:32:52.066
Who are you?

1205
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:53.354
I am Rancho

1206
01:32:54.658 --> 01:32:57.110
I swear on Papa, it's true

1207
01:32:57.324 --> 01:32:59.114
I am Rancho;
That was Chhote.

1208
01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.070
Chhote?

1209
01:33:02.448 --> 01:33:07.438
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1210
01:33:09.407 --> 01:33:12.238
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1211
01:33:14.449 --> 01:33:22.270
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1212
01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:24.977
He had a passion for learning

1213
01:33:28.239 --> 01:33:30.905
He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school

1214
01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:35.857
And attend any class he liked.
It suited me

1215
01:33:36.822 --> 01:33:42.855
I made him do my homework,
take my exams

1216
01:33:43.405 --> 01:33:46.439
It was going well, till
one day...

1217
01:33:46.864 --> 01:33:51.437
Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math

1218
01:33:51.488 --> 01:33:53.028
Which grade are you in, son?

1219
01:33:54.238 --> 01:33:55.435
What's your name?

1220
01:33:56.405 --> 01:33:57.352
We got caught

1221
01:33:58.488 --> 01:33:59.897
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1222
01:34:00.029 --> 01:34:03.526
our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal

1223
01:34:04.029 --> 01:34:07.975
You started it, you will finish it

1224
01:34:10.696 --> 01:34:13.480
People pretend to show me respect

1225
01:34:14.195 --> 01:34:16.399
But behind my back...

1226
01:34:17.363 --> 01:34:18.985
mock me as an illiterate

1227
01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:22.024
I won't let that happen to my son

1228
01:34:23.111 --> 01:34:27.436
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1229
01:34:27.987 --> 01:34:29.942
Let the game go on

1230
01:34:30.944 --> 01:34:32.568
Make this kid an engineer

1231
01:34:33.819 --> 01:34:39.188
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1232
01:34:39.528 --> 01:34:43.521
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1233
01:34:45.194 --> 01:34:51.357
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1234
01:34:53.402 --> 01:35:01.982
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1235
01:35:06.694 --> 01:35:08.351
He really misses you both

1236
01:35:10.776 --> 01:35:14.722
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1237
01:35:18.067 --> 01:35:21.563
But please keep my secret

1238
01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:24.603
What secret?

1239
01:35:37.942 --> 01:35:41.437
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1240
01:35:43.649 --> 01:35:46.220
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1241
01:35:46.275 --> 01:35:49.806
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1242
01:35:49.858 --> 01:35:52.144
Ignore it
- Where're we going?

1243
01:35:53.483 --> 01:35:54.395
Ladakh

1244
01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:55.815
Ladakh! Why?

1245
01:35:56.524 --> 01:35:57.472
To meet Rancho

1246
01:35:57.649 --> 01:36:00.647
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1247
01:36:00.691 --> 01:36:04.270
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1248
01:36:04.524 --> 01:36:07.605
School teacher!

1249
01:36:08.482 --> 01:36:11.895
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1250
01:36:12.315 --> 01:36:14.601
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1251
01:36:14.774 --> 01:36:15.970
D for Donkey

1252
01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:21.643
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1253
01:36:21.815 --> 01:36:24.848
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1254
01:36:28.564 --> 01:36:30.970
Today my respect
for that idiot shot up

1255
01:36:31.898 --> 01:36:34.221
Most of us went to college
just for a degree

1256
01:36:34.814 --> 01:36:39.021
No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...

1257
01:36:39.315 --> 01:36:41.884
no credit card, no social status

1258
01:36:42.564 --> 01:36:44.389
None of this mattered to him

1259
01:36:44.523 --> 01:36:46.347
He was in college
for the joy of learning

1260
01:36:46.856 --> 01:36:50.138
He never cared
if he was first or last

1261
01:36:50.731 --> 01:36:53.053
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1262
01:36:53.314 --> 01:36:54.510
Neil Armstrong, sir

1263
01:36:54.605 --> 01:36:56.761
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1264
01:36:56.938 --> 01:36:58.183
Who was the second?

1265
01:36:58.689 --> 01:37:00.311
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1266
01:37:00.772 --> 01:37:03.260
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1267
01:37:04.396 --> 01:37:09.847
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1268
01:37:10.313 --> 01:37:15.977
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1269
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:18.601
This is your last lap, my friends

1270
01:37:18.937 --> 01:37:21.142
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1271
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:23.220
Go out there and make history!

1272
01:37:26.645 --> 01:37:27.842
Any questions?

1273
01:37:30.395 --> 01:37:31.308
Yes?

1274
01:37:32.645 --> 01:37:36.259
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1275
01:37:36.645 --> 01:37:43.933
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1276
01:37:44.437 --> 01:37:45.764
Very good question

1277
01:37:49.019 --> 01:37:51.389
Anyone else
with the same question?

1278
01:37:53.311 --> 01:37:54.638
As expected

1279
01:37:56.978 --> 01:38:00.094
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1280
01:38:11.269 --> 01:38:13.555
For the last four years

1281
01:38:13.602 --> 01:38:16.553
they've been our most
consistent students

1282
01:38:16.685 --> 01:38:20.015
Consistently last in every exam

1283
01:38:20.852 --> 01:38:22.226
Come my geniuses, come

1284
01:38:23.684 --> 01:38:29.302
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1285
01:38:30.017 --> 01:38:33.051
'Cause they're completely unused

1286
01:38:35.559 --> 01:38:36.802
And to answer their question -

1287
01:38:37.183 --> 01:38:40.515
The exam won't affect their jobs

1288
01:38:41.308 --> 01:38:44.839
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1289
01:38:45.683 --> 01:38:48.717
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1290
01:38:49.017 --> 01:38:51.932
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1291
01:38:52.016 --> 01:38:53.510
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1292
01:39:02.599 --> 01:39:07.471
He screwed us;

1293
01:39:07.599 --> 01:39:09.555
In front of everyone

1294
01:39:10.682 --> 01:39:15.802
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1295
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:17.680
Do me just one favor -

1296
01:39:17.766 --> 01:39:20.218
Delete Virus!

1297
01:39:21.849 --> 01:39:23.839
Burn him in hell

1298
01:39:25.223 --> 01:39:29.052
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1299
01:39:29.806 --> 01:39:32.674
You think God is a contract killer?

1300
01:39:33.307 --> 01:39:34.585
You shut up

1301
01:39:35.307 --> 01:39:38.221
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1302
01:39:38.265 --> 01:39:40.220
We're rotting in the corner

1303
01:39:41.265 --> 01:39:44.297
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1304
01:39:46.764 --> 01:39:48.590
Know why I come first?
- Why?

1305
01:39:49.014 --> 01:39:50.721
Because I love machines

1306
01:39:51.514 --> 01:39:53.339
Engineering is my passion

1307
01:39:54.389 --> 01:39:55.633
Know your passion?

1308
01:39:58.472 --> 01:40:00.178
That's my bag
- Be quiet

1309
01:40:01.138 --> 01:40:02.466
What're you up to?

1310
01:40:04.889 --> 01:40:07.045
This... is your passion

1311
01:40:08.263 --> 01:40:09.721
Go post this letter

1312
01:40:10.097 --> 01:40:11.376
What letter?

1313
01:40:14.138 --> 01:40:18.427
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1314
01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.964
Andre...
- Istvan

1315
01:40:22.929 --> 01:40:26.544
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1316
01:40:27.471 --> 01:40:30.801
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1317
01:40:32.512 --> 01:40:36.092
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1318
01:40:37.054 --> 01:40:39.045
Follow your talent

1319
01:40:42.178 --> 01:40:46.218
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1320
01:40:47.011 --> 01:40:50.542
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1321
01:40:51.261 --> 01:40:52.589
imagine the disaster

1322
01:40:54.636 --> 01:40:57.172
Do you get it?

1323
01:41:00.719 --> 01:41:04.049
Idiot; Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1324
01:41:08.677 --> 01:41:10.087
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1325
01:41:11.386 --> 01:41:15.544
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1326
01:41:16.968 --> 01:41:19.504
But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1327
01:41:20.635 --> 01:41:23.005
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1328
01:41:24.718 --> 01:41:29.210
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1329
01:41:29.759 --> 01:41:32.959
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1330
01:41:34.426 --> 01:41:38.206
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1331
01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:40.710
How'll you focus on studies?

1332
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:45.126
Strange buddies; One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1333
01:41:46.134 --> 01:41:51.502
You live in both: fear and pretense

1334
01:41:51.717 --> 01:41:57.796
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1335
01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.374
What rubbish!

1336
01:42:03.008 --> 01:42:07.085
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1337
01:42:07.175 --> 01:42:10.421
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1338
01:42:10.883 --> 01:42:14.746
There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness

1339
01:42:14.841 --> 01:42:20.340
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1340
01:42:20.758 --> 01:42:25.214
I'll tell Dad: No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1341
01:42:26.383 --> 01:42:30.044
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1342
01:42:30.465 --> 01:42:31.544
Deal?

1343
01:42:33.757 --> 01:42:35.415
Have the guts?

1344
01:42:35.548 --> 01:42:37.835
His Holiness is speechless

1345
01:42:43.882 --> 01:42:44.747
Let's go

1346
01:42:49.798 --> 01:42:51.125
Follow me
- Where?

1347
01:42:56.756 --> 01:42:58.297
Let's go

1348
01:42:58.797 --> 01:43:01.922
Hey Virus; I'm anti-Virus

1349
01:43:01.922 --> 01:43:03.631
Hope no dog here

1350
01:43:03.631 --> 01:43:05.954
Cowards! Let's go

1351
01:43:06.089 --> 01:43:09.786
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1352
01:43:22.004 --> 01:43:23.628
Beware: Virus inside

1353
01:43:44.212 --> 01:43:45.409
Need background score?

1354
01:43:45.628 --> 01:43:46.623
Pia
- Who's it?

1355
01:43:49.379 --> 01:43:53.076
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1356
01:43:55.004 --> 01:43:58.416
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1357
01:43:58.712 --> 01:44:01.116
Say not a word...

1358
01:44:01.462 --> 01:44:02.456
Pia...
- Yes?

1359
01:44:04.586 --> 01:44:07.916
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1360
01:44:08.753 --> 01:44:13.326
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1361
01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:23.167
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1362
01:44:23.293 --> 01:44:24.158
Wow

1363
01:44:25.419 --> 01:44:28.535
...and time stands still

1364
01:44:29.585 --> 01:44:36.993
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1365
01:44:40.001 --> 01:44:42.324
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1366
01:44:45.793 --> 01:44:48.744
and come close to kiss me

1367
01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:54.120
But that kiss doesn't happen

1368
01:44:54.959 --> 01:44:55.871
Why?

1369
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:59.373
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1370
01:45:00.459 --> 01:45:02.117
The noses never collide, stupid!

1371
01:45:07.208 --> 01:45:10.325
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1372
01:45:10.917 --> 01:45:11.864
I wish I was

1373
01:45:12.166 --> 01:45:13.956
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1374
01:45:14.417 --> 01:45:16.241
It took him four years
to say this

1375
01:45:16.458 --> 01:45:19.491
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1376
01:45:19.583 --> 01:45:22.830
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1377
01:45:23.375 --> 01:45:25.033
Who's this?
- My sister

1378
01:45:26.041 --> 01:45:27.071
Who're you?

1379
01:45:36.749 --> 01:45:40.494
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time;

1380
01:45:40.541 --> 01:45:44.368
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1381
01:45:44.666 --> 01:45:48.706
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1382
01:45:49.665 --> 01:45:50.577
Meaning?

1383
01:45:50.748 --> 01:45:53.616
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1384
01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:59.914
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1385
01:46:00.998 --> 01:46:04.742
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1386
01:46:04.873 --> 01:46:10.288
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1387
01:46:11.122 --> 01:46:16.359
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1388
01:46:17.164 --> 01:46:20.529
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1389
01:46:21.413 --> 01:46:22.195
He kicked

1390
01:46:24.205 --> 01:46:25.283
Say it again

1391
01:46:26.497 --> 01:46:28.120
All is well

1392
01:46:28.996 --> 01:46:30.703
Kicked again

1393
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:35.327
Once more
- All is well

1394
01:46:39.829 --> 01:46:43.989
All is well

1395
01:46:44.579 --> 01:46:45.527
Who is it?

1396
01:46:46.371 --> 01:46:47.366
Go

1397
01:46:48.037 --> 01:46:53.073
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1398
01:46:53.162 --> 01:46:57.618
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading;

1399
01:47:04.079 --> 01:47:06.828
Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law

1400
01:47:07.078 --> 01:47:08.571
And the wedding party

1401
01:47:09.411 --> 01:47:10.490
Rastogi;

1402
01:47:12.911 --> 01:47:14.737
Security, that way

1403
01:47:44.327 --> 01:47:48.071
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1404
01:47:48.785 --> 01:47:52.695
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1405
01:47:54.118 --> 01:47:58.111
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1406
01:47:58.534 --> 01:47:59.612
Let me demonstrate to you

1407
01:48:00.201 --> 01:48:02.156
What's this?
- Pencil

1408
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:03.908
What's inside?
- Lead

1409
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:06.107
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1410
01:48:06.617 --> 01:48:09.615
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1411
01:48:17.242 --> 01:48:19.861
Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir

1412
01:48:27.324 --> 01:48:29.232
Hi. Everybody is here

1413
01:48:30.908 --> 01:48:31.986
Good morning, sir

1414
01:48:32.908 --> 01:48:34.105
Where were you last night?

1415
01:48:34.658 --> 01:48:37.739
Studying all night, sir
- Studying?

1416
01:48:37.908 --> 01:48:38.856
Really?

1417
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:41.989
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1418
01:48:42.074 --> 01:48:42.986
Not slept?

1419
01:48:43.158 --> 01:48:44.187
What did you study?

1420
01:48:45.282 --> 01:48:49.323
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1421
01:48:49.616 --> 01:48:50.528
Whole chapter?

1422
01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:52.777
In that case, Mr. Ra ju Rastogi...

1423
01:48:52.865 --> 01:48:53.778
Yessir!

1424
01:48:53.907 --> 01:48:56.573
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1425
01:49:04.656 --> 01:49:05.569
Stop it

1426
01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:15.526
Sir, rum

1427
01:49:17.406 --> 01:49:18.436
Mr. Rastogi

1428
01:49:18.906 --> 01:49:21.276
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1429
01:49:27.363 --> 01:49:28.312
Sir?

1430
01:49:29.489 --> 01:49:30.401
Close the door

1431
01:49:35.655 --> 01:49:36.733
Can you type?

1432
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.895
Yes, sir

1433
01:49:39.072 --> 01:49:40.564
Will you type a letter for me?

1434
01:49:42.655 --> 01:49:43.733
Definitely, sir

1435
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.978
Come, sit

1436
01:49:45.738 --> 01:49:46.768
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1437
01:49:49.154 --> 01:49:50.102
Please type

1438
01:49:51.779 --> 01:49:52.609
Dear Sir...

1439
01:49:53.571 --> 01:49:56.984
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1440
01:49:58.279 --> 01:50:00.946
that your son is rusticated...

1441
01:50:01.738 --> 01:50:04.307
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back

1442
01:50:05.029 --> 01:50:09.105
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1443
01:50:10.195 --> 01:50:14.354
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1444
01:50:14.945 --> 01:50:16.354
Come on, type

1445
01:50:23.819 --> 01:50:25.526
It'll kill my dad, sir

1446
01:50:25.694 --> 01:50:27.484
Please type
- Sir, please sir

1447
01:50:27.944 --> 01:50:31.890
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1448
01:50:33.944 --> 01:50:39.099
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1449
01:50:39.152 --> 01:50:43.442
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1450
01:50:43.569 --> 01:50:48.024
Sir, give me one chance... please

1451
01:50:53.610 --> 01:50:57.023
Ok, remove your name
from the letter...

1452
01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.516
and put in Rancho's

1453
01:51:01.943 --> 01:51:04.146
I know he was with you
last night

1454
01:51:04.984 --> 01:51:09.060
Be my witness and
I'll spare you

1455
01:51:12.609 --> 01:51:16.650
You have 7 1/2 minutes to think

1456
01:52:03.731 --> 01:52:08.685
We won't let go of you

1457
01:52:10.107 --> 01:52:15.605
We're not done yet... no way

1458
01:52:17.731 --> 01:52:20.931
The heavens may beckon you

1459
01:52:21.022 --> 01:52:24.223
But we'll take up arms against God

1460
01:52:24.273 --> 01:52:30.352
And it's not a fight we intend to lose

1461
01:52:30.897 --> 01:52:34.014
You may try your best to escape

1462
01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:37.346
Try with all your might

1463
01:52:37.522 --> 01:52:44.135
But there is no way
we are letting go of you

1464
01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:50.809
We won't let go of you

1465
01:52:51.271 --> 01:52:57.552
We're not done yet... no way

1466
01:52:59.396 --> 01:53:02.145
Rancho, watch that monitor

1467
01:53:02.438 --> 01:53:03.219
Raju

1468
01:53:05.021 --> 01:53:08.184
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1469
01:53:08.687 --> 01:53:13.012
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1470
01:53:14.854 --> 01:53:19.262
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1471
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:24.936
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1472
01:53:25.104 --> 01:53:26.512
The new medicine worked

1473
01:53:26.936 --> 01:53:29.769
Is this your family tradition -

1474
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:33.936
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1475
01:53:33.936 --> 01:53:35.594
Come, wake up

1476
01:53:36.477 --> 01:53:37.887
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1477
01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.847
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1478
01:53:47.852 --> 01:53:52.177
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1479
01:53:54.435 --> 01:53:57.268
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1480
01:53:57.602 --> 01:53:59.842
Problem solved... Wake up now

1481
01:54:00.144 --> 01:54:02.893
Everything's resolved;
You hear that?

1482
01:54:03.268 --> 01:54:06.100
Rise and shine, buddy

1483
01:54:07.685 --> 01:54:10.884
In this journey of few strides

1484
01:54:11.101 --> 01:54:14.052
On the path called life

1485
01:54:14.268 --> 01:54:20.098
Don't quit...
Just celebrate the ride

1486
01:54:20.893 --> 01:54:24.056
Listen please to those
who love you

1487
01:54:24.184 --> 01:54:27.217
Every dark night is
followed by sunrise

1488
01:54:27.559 --> 01:54:32.797
Don't shut out those
who love you

1489
01:54:33.017 --> 01:54:39.512
We won't let go of you

1490
01:54:39.641 --> 01:54:45.970
We're not done yet... no way

1491
01:54:46.183 --> 01:54:52.594
We won't let go of you

1492
01:54:52.724 --> 01:55:00.297
We're not done yet... no way

1493
01:55:03.641 --> 01:55:07.504
Look, mom bought a new saree
- Brand new

1494
01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.264
It cost 2000 /-

1495
01:55:09.932 --> 01:55:11.175
Wake up now

1496
01:55:12.348 --> 01:55:14.469
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1497
01:55:14.932 --> 01:55:15.844
Look!

1498
01:55:17.932 --> 01:55:19.045
Hey Raju;

1499
01:55:19.098 --> 01:55:22.132
C'mon tell me... How do I look?

1500
01:55:23.223 --> 01:55:26.305
Remember the letters
mom would write...

1501
01:55:26.432 --> 01:55:29.548
Always blessed you
with eternal life

1502
01:55:29.723 --> 01:55:35.837
Don't die on her... you can 't die

1503
01:55:36.223 --> 01:55:39.423
Look at us now, don't turn away

1504
01:55:39.555 --> 01:55:42.672
Smile once to show you care

1505
01:55:42.847 --> 01:55:51.427
Wake up,
don't torment us anymore

1506
01:55:55.472 --> 01:55:59.631
Did you hear about your sis?

1507
01:56:00.555 --> 01:56:03.256
She's getting married

1508
01:56:04.263 --> 01:56:05.590
Without any dowry

1509
01:56:06.263 --> 01:56:11.169
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1510
01:56:11.388 --> 01:56:14.883
He just wants Kammo

1511
01:56:15.512 --> 01:56:19.672
You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah

1512
01:56:19.721 --> 01:56:20.585
Guess;

1513
01:56:20.637 --> 01:56:22.544
You know him very well
- Yes

1514
01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.379
He loves animals
- Huh...?

1515
01:56:24.554 --> 01:56:27.220
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1516
01:56:27.304 --> 01:56:28.880
Quiet... Shhhh...

1517
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:32.134
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1518
01:56:33.095 --> 01:56:37.219
Farhan will never take any dowry

1519
01:56:37.803 --> 01:56:42.212
Farhan will marry your sister

1520
01:56:42.636 --> 01:56:46.795
For free; Free! Free;

1521
01:56:51.386 --> 01:56:53.791
Raju

1522
01:56:56.927 --> 01:57:00.707
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1523
01:57:01.094 --> 01:57:02.800
Why sacrifice me...!

1524
01:57:03.093 --> 01:57:05.084
Well done, buddy

1525
01:57:05.886 --> 01:57:09.417
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1526
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:11.505
Rancho

1527
01:57:14.135 --> 01:57:17.298
Rascals... Stop fibbing

1528
01:57:19.884 --> 01:57:20.915
Lucky escape;

1529
01:57:21.093 --> 01:57:27.505
We won't let go of you

1530
01:57:27.634 --> 01:57:34.045
We're not done yet... no way

1531
01:57:34.259 --> 01:57:40.623
We won't let go of you

1532
01:57:40.801 --> 01:57:46.797
We're not done yet... no way

1533
01:57:46.842 --> 01:57:53.337
We won 't let go of you

1534
01:57:53.674 --> 01:57:55.416
'Okra Rs.12 / kilo'

1535
01:58:04.716 --> 01:58:06.292
You called for a taxi?

1536
01:58:06.341 --> 01:58:08.130
I did
- It's waiting

1537
01:58:08.257 --> 01:58:09.750
Thank you. Why?

1538
01:58:10.174 --> 01:58:11.501
I'm going to the job interview

1539
01:58:11.757 --> 01:58:13.001
You coming with me?

1540
01:58:13.382 --> 01:58:18.004
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1541
01:58:18.132 --> 01:58:19.506
Why would I go home?

1542
01:58:21.007 --> 01:58:24.455
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1543
01:58:27.799 --> 01:58:29.872
Give me your tie

1544
01:58:31.423 --> 01:58:32.288
Why?

1545
01:58:32.506 --> 01:58:36.417
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1546
01:58:37.339 --> 01:58:38.251
What's that?

1547
01:58:38.423 --> 01:58:41.290
A letter
- For you, from Hungary

1548
01:58:41.631 --> 01:58:44.250
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1549
01:58:52.172 --> 01:58:53.962
You posted my letter!

1550
01:58:54.130 --> 01:58:55.837
He loved your pictures

1551
01:58:56.297 --> 01:58:58.964
The guy wants you to assist him...

1552
01:58:59.755 --> 01:59:03.286
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1553
01:59:03.631 --> 01:59:05.253
Will pay you, too

1554
01:59:21.171 --> 01:59:22.450
Dad will never agree

1555
01:59:25.045 --> 01:59:27.713
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1556
01:59:29.379 --> 01:59:30.540
For once, dump your fears...

1557
01:59:31.212 --> 01:59:37.244
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1558
01:59:37.754 --> 01:59:40.325
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1559
01:59:40.462 --> 01:59:44.242
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1560
01:59:50.795 --> 01:59:52.750
Do you think he'll like it?

1561
01:59:53.378 --> 01:59:55.701
Why such an expensive gift?

1562
01:59:56.836 --> 01:59:59.289
Our son's getting
his first job today

1563
02:00:00.586 --> 02:00:04.496
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1564
02:00:06.418 --> 02:00:07.413
Farhan?

1565
02:00:12.502 --> 02:00:14.788
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1566
02:00:16.543 --> 02:00:17.455
I didn't go

1567
02:00:20.210 --> 02:00:21.952
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1568
02:00:26.168 --> 02:00:28.123
What happened?
You had an accident?

1569
02:00:31.751 --> 02:00:36.988
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1570
02:00:39.792 --> 02:00:40.705
Why?

1571
02:00:41.042 --> 02:00:43.366
Because I was rusticated
from college

1572
02:00:46.293 --> 02:00:47.121
Why?

1573
02:00:47.625 --> 02:00:52.448
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1574
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:58.411
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1575
02:00:58.542 --> 02:01:02.287
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1576
02:01:04.417 --> 02:01:09.038
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1577
02:01:09.375 --> 02:01:10.951
Then work will become play

1578
02:01:11.083 --> 02:01:12.990
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1579
02:01:13.625 --> 02:01:17.286
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1580
02:01:17.333 --> 02:01:18.529
Five years from now...

1581
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:23.989
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1582
02:01:24.082 --> 02:01:28.075
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1583
02:01:30.124 --> 02:01:31.914
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1584
02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:33.238
The world will laugh!

1585
02:01:34.499 --> 02:01:36.489
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1586
02:01:37.373 --> 02:01:43.073
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1587
02:01:43.332 --> 02:01:45.488
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1588
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:50.576
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1589
02:01:52.915 --> 02:01:55.912
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1590
02:01:58.747 --> 02:01:59.991
You did all that, Dad

1591
02:02:02.456 --> 02:02:07.906
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1592
02:02:09.039 --> 02:02:10.946
I don't even know his first name

1593
02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:13.995
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1594
02:02:14.163 --> 02:02:16.912
Enough, please... he's upset

1595
02:02:18.163 --> 02:02:20.616
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1596
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:22.406
Then the discussion is over

1597
02:02:22.704 --> 02:02:26.485
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1598
02:02:29.954 --> 02:02:34.944
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1599
02:02:37.454 --> 02:02:44.445
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1600
02:02:46.037 --> 02:02:49.865
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1601
02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:53.277
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1602
02:02:53.328 --> 02:02:55.118
when you see my dead body

1603
02:03:00.662 --> 02:03:04.441
I want to convince you, Dad

1604
02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:08.364
but not with a suicide threat

1605
02:03:12.119 --> 02:03:15.947
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1606
02:03:16.244 --> 02:03:17.488
I'll earn less

1607
02:03:18.411 --> 02:03:20.117
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1608
02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:23.701
But I'll be happy

1609
02:03:25.368 --> 02:03:26.648
I will be really happy

1610
02:03:27.952 --> 02:03:29.610
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1611
02:03:31.535 --> 02:03:33.276
I've always listened to you

1612
02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:36.777
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1613
02:03:38.868 --> 02:03:39.780
Please... Dad

1614
02:03:46.201 --> 02:03:47.149
Dad...

1615
02:03:48.368 --> 02:03:49.611
Please don't go away...

1616
02:03:55.825 --> 02:03:57.022
Return this

1617
02:04:00.492 --> 02:04:02.980
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1618
02:04:04.241 --> 02:04:06.031
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1619
02:04:07.492 --> 02:04:09.363
If you need more money, just ask

1620
02:04:18.158 --> 02:04:20.113
Go live your life, my son

1621
02:04:23.033 --> 02:04:27.322
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1622
02:04:27.991 --> 02:04:28.856
Fear

1623
02:04:29.949 --> 02:04:31.358
I was a good student
since childhood

1624
02:04:32.115 --> 02:04:34.272
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1625
02:04:36.199 --> 02:04:37.194
That scared me

1626
02:04:38.699 --> 02:04:42.146
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1627
02:04:43.907 --> 02:04:44.937
My fear grew

1628
02:04:46.615 --> 02:04:48.072
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1629
02:04:48.698 --> 02:04:51.104
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1630
02:04:52.115 --> 02:04:56.571
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1631
02:04:59.656 --> 02:05:02.773
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1632
02:05:03.322 --> 02:05:04.566
Finally, sense dawned

1633
02:05:06.072 --> 02:05:11.227
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1634
02:05:13.697 --> 02:05:17.690
If you reject me, no regrets

1635
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:22.154
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1636
02:05:22.696 --> 02:05:27.899
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1637
02:05:28.488 --> 02:05:32.778
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1638
02:05:32.863 --> 02:05:35.232
You're too straightforward

1639
02:05:37.112 --> 02:05:37.942
But...

1640
02:05:39.113 --> 02:05:45.559
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1641
02:05:45.696 --> 02:05:48.693
we may consider you

1642
02:05:52.029 --> 02:05:55.193
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1643
02:05:57.070 --> 02:05:58.895
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1644
02:05:59.612 --> 02:06:00.477
Can't change it, sir

1645
02:06:04.153 --> 02:06:09.390
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1646
02:06:09.528 --> 02:06:10.902
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1647
02:06:15.278 --> 02:06:16.143
Wait

1648
02:06:18.111 --> 02:06:22.104
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1649
02:06:22.528 --> 02:06:25.395
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1650
02:06:25.569 --> 02:06:26.943
Where did you spring from, son?

1651
02:06:28.861 --> 02:06:29.690
Sir?

1652
02:06:29.944 --> 02:06:32.562
Shall we discuss the salary?

1653
02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:41.022
Thank you, sir

1654
02:07:13.567 --> 02:07:17.774
Your Majesty, thou art great

1655
02:07:19.692 --> 02:07:21.350
Accept this humble offering

1656
02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:01.387
Govind!

1657
02:08:03.439 --> 02:08:06.935
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1658
02:08:14.147 --> 02:08:15.178
What have you done?

1659
02:08:18.773 --> 02:08:22.184
I feel naked without
my moustache

1660
02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.388
I've lost my dignity

1661
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.933
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1662
02:08:32.230 --> 02:08:36.270
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1663
02:08:37.730 --> 02:08:41.676
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1664
02:08:44.855 --> 02:08:47.473
Dad, that's not fair

1665
02:08:49.813 --> 02:08:53.344
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1666
02:08:53.854 --> 02:08:57.184
And this is World War... III

1667
02:08:58.646 --> 02:08:59.676
Rastogi, you're dead meat;

1668
02:09:04.646 --> 02:09:05.558
Hey

1669
02:09:07.979 --> 02:09:08.891
What're you doing here?

1670
02:09:11.853 --> 02:09:12.718
Be careful

1671
02:09:18.395 --> 02:09:22.258
You've been drinking
- Yup, had to down a couple

1672
02:09:22.811 --> 02:09:25.016
A couple too many;

1673
02:09:25.103 --> 02:09:27.010
Needed the guts
- For what?

1674
02:09:28.769 --> 02:09:30.309
For stealing this
- What's this?

1675
02:09:31.394 --> 02:09:35.553
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1676
02:09:38.061 --> 02:09:40.383
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1677
02:09:41.061 --> 02:09:45.054
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1678
02:09:45.352 --> 02:09:46.300
Go get it;

1679
02:09:47.351 --> 02:09:49.922
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating;

1680
02:09:54.393 --> 02:09:57.640
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1681
02:09:59.143 --> 02:10:00.173
Tell me something...

1682
02:10:02.101 --> 02:10:03.298
Do you really feel...

1683
02:10:04.851 --> 02:10:10.386
the noses collide while kissing?

1684
02:10:15.809 --> 02:10:19.553
Wait. Have some dhokla

1685
02:10:22.017 --> 02:10:24.635
You Gujaratis are so cute

1686
02:10:25.559 --> 02:10:28.889
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1687
02:10:29.975 --> 02:10:35.212
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1688
02:10:36.308 --> 02:10:38.464
Sound like missiles

1689
02:10:38.516 --> 02:10:39.380
C'mon

1690
02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.088
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1691
02:10:42.724 --> 02:10:45.592
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1692
02:10:45.933 --> 02:10:46.845
C'mon

1693
02:10:50.308 --> 02:10:51.303
Oh...

1694
02:10:52.807 --> 02:10:57.263
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1695
02:10:58.182 --> 02:11:01.512
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad': Yuck

1696
02:11:02.723 --> 02:11:05.294
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1697
02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:10.138
Pia, we can't get married

1698
02:11:13.682 --> 02:11:14.594
Why?

1699
02:11:15.432 --> 02:11:16.888
Is there someone else?

1700
02:11:19.389 --> 02:11:20.254
No

1701
02:11:20.556 --> 02:11:22.298
Are you gay?
- No

1702
02:11:24.139 --> 02:11:26.046
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1703
02:11:30.597 --> 02:11:32.054
Are you impotent?
- No

1704
02:11:34.722 --> 02:11:36.547
Then prove it

1705
02:11:37.014 --> 02:11:37.962
Pia, no

1706
02:11:38.221 --> 02:11:39.679
Stop, stop;

1707
02:11:39.847 --> 02:11:42.216
What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia

1708
02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:44.754
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1709
02:11:44.805 --> 02:11:46.677
Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1710
02:11:46.971 --> 02:11:50.135
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1711
02:11:56.596 --> 02:11:57.425
Hello

1712
02:11:57.513 --> 02:11:59.752
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1713
02:11:59.804 --> 02:12:03.217
Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not

1714
02:12:03.596 --> 02:12:05.385
Is she at the hospital?

1715
02:12:05.512 --> 02:12:07.088
Why would she be there?

1716
02:12:07.304 --> 02:12:09.508
She's getting married today -
in Manali

1717
02:12:17.511 --> 02:12:18.756
Too late! She's married

1718
02:12:20.179 --> 02:12:23.093
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1719
02:12:23.428 --> 02:12:25.502
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1720
02:12:26.011 --> 02:12:26.876
What do you say?

1721
02:12:28.802 --> 02:12:31.256
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1722
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:33.211
No turning back

1723
02:12:33.678 --> 02:12:36.427
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1724
02:12:36.594 --> 02:12:39.165
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1725
02:12:39.303 --> 02:12:40.843
Get into the car

1726
02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:44.050
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1727
02:12:44.261 --> 02:12:47.341
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1728
02:12:47.468 --> 02:12:49.756
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1729
02:13:23.384 --> 02:13:25.540
Pia weds Suhas;
- Thanks for the suit

1730
02:13:27.883 --> 02:13:29.377
Virus will have a heart attack

1731
02:13:30.467 --> 02:13:33.168
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1732
02:13:34.591 --> 02:13:38.004
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1733
02:13:54.799 --> 02:13:57.039
Farhan
- We found Rancho

1734
02:14:05.174 --> 02:14:06.797
For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1735
02:14:07.507 --> 02:14:10.339
You've taken ages
- Sorry, sir

1736
02:14:10.465 --> 02:14:11.330
Off, now

1737
02:14:20.382 --> 02:14:22.088
Housekeeping, sir
- Come in

1738
02:14:22.631 --> 02:14:25.249
Amore... Amore...

1739
02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:26.714
Quick, iron my coat

1740
02:14:26.798 --> 02:14:29.630
Amore... Amore...

1741
02:14:30.506 --> 02:14:33.753
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1742
02:14:34.255 --> 02:14:35.334
You're mad, Farhan

1743
02:14:36.464 --> 02:14:39.131
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1744
02:14:39.338 --> 02:14:41.293
You're still eating his favorite food

1745
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:44.208
Amore... Amore...

1746
02:14:59.629 --> 02:15:03.837
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1747
02:15:03.921 --> 02:15:06.789
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1748
02:15:07.337 --> 02:15:09.328
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1749
02:15:09.379 --> 02:15:12.579
My 150,000/: coat

1750
02:15:12.671 --> 02:15:14.791
Why do you people eat sauce?

1751
02:15:14.837 --> 02:15:17.326
I'll sort it out, sir
- How?

1752
02:15:17.421 --> 02:15:19.991
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1753
02:15:20.128 --> 02:15:22.119
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1754
02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:28.747
Get it soon

1755
02:15:29.712 --> 02:15:31.951
But it's too late now, Farhan
- Pia

1756
02:15:32.837 --> 02:15:35.076
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1757
02:15:46.502 --> 02:15:49.832
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1758
02:15:55.002 --> 02:15:55.915
Where is Suhas?

1759
02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:58.709
Housekeeping took my coat

1760
02:15:59.168 --> 02:16:00.958
Go... Send Suhas here

1761
02:16:01.169 --> 02:16:04.369
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1762
02:16:15.668 --> 02:16:17.326
Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1763
02:16:17.668 --> 02:16:20.287
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1764
02:16:21.793 --> 02:16:23.416
Sir...
- My coat?

1765
02:16:23.459 --> 02:16:24.626
You're here...

1766
02:16:24.626 --> 02:16:26.416
So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1767
02:16:28.710 --> 02:16:31.198
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1768
02:16:31.376 --> 02:16:33.662
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1769
02:16:34.126 --> 02:16:37.408
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1770
02:16:37.667 --> 02:16:39.457
So you'll commit suicide?

1771
02:16:40.042 --> 02:16:40.954
Rastogi;

1772
02:16:41.042 --> 02:16:43.162
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1773
02:16:44.542 --> 02:16:47.625
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1774
02:16:47.625 --> 02:16:50.576
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1775
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:54.245
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1776
02:16:56.416 --> 02:16:57.364
Housekeeping?

1777
02:17:37.081 --> 02:17:40.115
Pia, minor problem

1778
02:17:40.414 --> 02:17:41.279
What?

1779
02:17:41.706 --> 02:17:43.328
We don't know if Rancho's married

1780
02:17:43.373 --> 02:17:44.237
What;

1781
02:17:44.331 --> 02:17:46.997
He won't be married
- And if he is?

1782
02:17:47.873 --> 02:17:49.281
Then we'll drop you back

1783
02:17:50.163 --> 02:17:53.944
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1784
02:17:57.789 --> 02:17:58.653
What's he doing here?

1785
02:17:59.705 --> 02:18:03.117
Ignore him
- The biscuit's very good

1786
02:18:04.163 --> 02:18:06.035
Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen

1787
02:18:06.539 --> 02:18:10.402
But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft

1788
02:18:11.204 --> 02:18:13.658
almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and

1789
02:18:13.913 --> 02:18:18.321
made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho

1790
02:18:19.788 --> 02:18:21.908
But he too would do
anything for friends

1791
02:18:22.162 --> 02:18:25.658
Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den

1792
02:18:25.745 --> 02:18:26.776
Envelope with the red seal

1793
02:18:27.787 --> 02:18:32.777
He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump

1794
02:18:35.954 --> 02:18:41.239
We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju

1795
02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:42.733
We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek

1796
02:18:45.453 --> 02:18:46.780
Where's it hidden...

1797
02:18:46.911 --> 02:18:50.573
We'll grow old searching;
Ask Pia

1798
02:18:56.786 --> 02:18:57.947
Pia, your phone

1799
02:18:59.203 --> 02:19:02.449
Mr. Papa-To-Be;
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1800
02:19:02.536 --> 02:19:03.365
He kicked

1801
02:19:05.827 --> 02:19:07.319
Pia, your phone

1802
02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:14.404
Found it! Rancho

1803
02:19:15.868 --> 02:19:16.863
Hello?

1804
02:19:35.284 --> 02:19:37.524
Quick, photocopy this

1805
02:19:58.700 --> 02:19:59.481
Where was it?

1806
02:19:59.783 --> 02:20:00.778
Put it back

1807
02:20:24.116 --> 02:20:26.152
We're safe!
- Where were you?

1808
02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:32.446
Here
- What's this?

1809
02:20:32.782 --> 02:20:33.694
A gift

1810
02:20:34.824 --> 02:20:38.734
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1811
02:20:46.322 --> 02:20:47.650
Strange buddies;

1812
02:20:48.989 --> 02:20:53.563
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1813
02:20:55.614 --> 02:20:56.644
No way

1814
02:20:58.239 --> 02:20:59.613
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1815
02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:04.650
If I don't, it's still ok

1816
02:21:21.863 --> 02:21:26.401
He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...

1817
02:21:27.321 --> 02:21:29.228
but then I controlled my emotions

1818
02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:51.271
Damn thief
- Sir, please, sir

1819
02:21:51.445 --> 02:21:54.645
Rascal
- Sorry sir

1820
02:21:55.195 --> 02:21:56.474
Wanted to change the system

1821
02:21:58.194 --> 02:22:03.147
You'll pee on my door
- Sir, what're you doing

1822
02:22:04.652 --> 02:22:05.647
Sorry sir

1823
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:08.983
You are rusticated!

1824
02:22:09.778 --> 02:22:12.775
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1825
02:22:13.152 --> 02:22:14.526
I will call the police;

1826
02:22:17.028 --> 02:22:17.856
Rascals;

1827
02:22:18.194 --> 02:22:19.520
Rascals, all of you

1828
02:22:23.527 --> 02:22:25.850
How did he get my office key?

1829
02:22:27.151 --> 02:22:28.561
I gave him the key, Dad

1830
02:22:29.944 --> 02:22:33.735
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1831
02:22:33.735 --> 02:22:34.648
Stop it, Pia

1832
02:22:35.776 --> 02:22:38.609
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1833
02:22:39.152 --> 02:22:40.064
Shut up, Pia

1834
02:22:40.151 --> 02:22:42.437
You decided he'd be an engineer

1835
02:22:42.610 --> 02:22:44.896
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1836
02:22:45.692 --> 02:22:47.268
You put such pressure on him...

1837
02:22:47.650 --> 02:22:49.937
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1838
02:22:54.192 --> 02:22:55.057
I don't understand...

1839
02:22:55.859 --> 02:22:58.429
Dad, you go to your room

1840
02:23:02.317 --> 02:23:04.686
Pia, don't do this

1841
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:11.060
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1842
02:23:13.316 --> 02:23:15.804
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1843
02:23:15.858 --> 02:23:17.137
Put that away, please

1844
02:23:17.316 --> 02:23:18.975
No more cover-ups!

1845
02:23:22.358 --> 02:23:25.604
Just once...

1846
02:23:25.649 --> 02:23:29.346
if you'd said: Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1847
02:23:30.191 --> 02:23:31.600
just do what your heart is in

1848
02:23:33.065 --> 02:23:34.807
then he'd be alive today

1849
02:23:42.731 --> 02:23:44.806
He didn't commit suicide

1850
02:23:45.524 --> 02:23:46.517
You're right, Dad

1851
02:23:48.065 --> 02:23:49.309
It wasn't suicide...

1852
02:23:51.773 --> 02:23:52.851
It was murder

1853
02:24:08.772 --> 02:24:11.640
Many city roads are
completely submerged

1854
02:24:11.689 --> 02:24:13.679
Traffic has come to a standstill

1855
02:24:27.605 --> 02:24:31.432
Dad...

1856
02:24:32.521 --> 02:24:33.469
Mona?

1857
02:24:37.646 --> 02:24:40.134
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1858
02:24:40.687 --> 02:24:42.973
Why?
Your pop owns the road?

1859
02:24:43.104 --> 02:24:44.810
Please help,
we are desperate here;

1860
02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:47.642
You can't send an ambulance?

1861
02:24:48.645 --> 02:24:50.552
Get it from another hospital

1862
02:24:51.186 --> 02:24:54.718
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1863
02:24:58.229 --> 02:24:59.507
Mona, you ok?

1864
02:25:00.061 --> 02:25:01.056
Rancho, Pia

1865
02:25:03.437 --> 02:25:07.300
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1866
02:25:07.603 --> 02:25:12.473
The water bag has burst

1867
02:25:13.478 --> 02:25:16.013
Disconnected! Mona

1868
02:25:21.227 --> 02:25:22.222
Mona!

1869
02:25:26.602 --> 02:25:28.142
Turn on the lights
- Where to?

1870
02:25:28.644 --> 02:25:32.589
To the table tennis table
- Pia, we're in the common room

1871
02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:38.432
Raju, turn on the web camera

1872
02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:45.721
Where's Mona? Show me

1873
02:25:47.268 --> 02:25:48.216
Hold on

1874
02:25:50.435 --> 02:25:51.299
Here, Pia

1875
02:25:51.601 --> 02:25:54.515
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1876
02:25:54.601 --> 02:25:55.596
Pia, I'm dying!

1877
02:25:55.976 --> 02:25:58.595
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1878
02:25:58.726 --> 02:26:00.135
babies were delivered

1879
02:26:00.726 --> 02:26:03.049
You all will deliver this baby

1880
02:26:05.725 --> 02:26:07.301
All is well

1881
02:26:07.433 --> 02:26:10.431
How dare you? I'll kill you

1882
02:26:10.558 --> 02:26:12.596
Dad, stay out of this

1883
02:26:13.558 --> 02:26:15.715
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1884
02:26:15.767 --> 02:26:18.255
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1885
02:26:18.516 --> 02:26:20.009
Rancho, cover Mona

1886
02:26:27.558 --> 02:26:29.098
Mona, try pushing

1887
02:26:29.516 --> 02:26:33.462
Push with all your might

1888
02:26:33.724 --> 02:26:36.129
Stop it! I can't do it

1889
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:38.174
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1890
02:26:39.099 --> 02:26:39.963
Crowning...?

1891
02:26:41.307 --> 02:26:42.219
Get that diagram

1892
02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:47.889
See if the head is coming out

1893
02:26:50.224 --> 02:26:51.550
Check quickly

1894
02:26:52.307 --> 02:26:53.254
Go;

1895
02:26:53.932 --> 02:26:56.420
Go, Rancho, go

1896
02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:05.802
No crowning

1897
02:27:05.848 --> 02:27:07.755
Mona, please push

1898
02:27:10.431 --> 02:27:11.295
Mona!

1899
02:27:14.306 --> 02:27:15.467
She's tired, Pia

1900
02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:19.586
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1901
02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:23.711
They need a vacuum cup
- Where will they get one?

1902
02:27:23.889 --> 02:27:26.756
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1903
02:27:27.014 --> 02:27:27.878
I'll show you

1904
02:27:31.139 --> 02:27:35.464
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1905
02:27:35.763 --> 02:27:39.543
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1906
02:27:40.221 --> 02:27:42.128
and the baby is pulled out

1907
02:27:42.596 --> 02:27:44.800
I can make this
- How?

1908
02:27:45.054 --> 02:27:46.880
With a vacuum cleaner
- Vacuum cleaner?

1909
02:27:46.930 --> 02:27:48.007
Yes

1910
02:27:48.054 --> 02:27:50.424
That pressure's too high

1911
02:27:50.470 --> 02:27:52.627
I'll control it
- D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1912
02:27:52.679 --> 02:27:53.757
Yes, in my office

1913
02:27:54.179 --> 02:27:56.880
Farhan, rush and get it
- Here's the key

1914
02:28:02.887 --> 02:28:06.335
Mona, push

1915
02:28:07.095 --> 02:28:08.635
Oh my God

1916
02:28:09.512 --> 02:28:10.424
What happened?

1917
02:28:15.303 --> 02:28:17.589
Raju, what happened?
- The power's gone

1918
02:28:18.553 --> 02:28:20.010
How'll the vacuum work now?

1919
02:28:20.053 --> 02:28:22.623
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1920
02:28:22.678 --> 02:28:23.673
How?

1921
02:28:24.344 --> 02:28:25.837
Millimeter, get Virus out

1922
02:28:27.219 --> 02:28:29.885
What nonsense is this!

1923
02:28:30.094 --> 02:28:33.673
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1924
02:28:33.844 --> 02:28:35.751
Get that, quick
- Ok

1925
02:28:36.011 --> 02:28:38.167
Raju, wake up the hostel

1926
02:28:38.344 --> 02:28:41.295
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1927
02:28:44.135 --> 02:28:46.801
Emergency in the common room!

1928
02:29:17.592 --> 02:29:19.713
Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1929
02:29:19.967 --> 02:29:22.669
Keep the batteries here
...and the wires

1930
02:29:24.925 --> 02:29:28.124
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1931
02:29:32.925 --> 02:29:34.122
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1932
02:29:35.258 --> 02:29:38.172
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1933
02:29:38.217 --> 02:29:39.673
Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1934
02:29:42.383 --> 02:29:43.412
Rancho, blower

1935
02:29:43.549 --> 02:29:45.587
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1936
02:30:11.964 --> 02:30:13.243
Rancho, I'm done

1937
02:30:15.673 --> 02:30:16.834
All switches off?
- Yes

1938
02:30:18.381 --> 02:30:20.003
Hit the table
and computer switches

1939
02:30:20.048 --> 02:30:20.913
Ok

1940
02:30:33.588 --> 02:30:34.702
Raju, turn on the computer

1941
02:30:35.088 --> 02:30:36.795
Farhan, here

1942
02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:40.918
Pia, come here quick

1943
02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:44.493
Love you, Rancho

1944
02:30:45.254 --> 02:30:47.245
Farhan, turn it on
- Ok

1945
02:30:53.796 --> 02:30:55.833
Pia, how much suction?

1946
02:30:56.212 --> 02:30:57.670
Not more than 0.5

1947
02:30:57.879 --> 02:30:59.917
Farhan, 0.5
- Cover it

1948
02:31:01.462 --> 02:31:02.375
0.5

1949
02:31:04.921 --> 02:31:08.961
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1950
02:31:10.045 --> 02:31:10.875
Farhan, stop

1951
02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:11.749
Ok

1952
02:31:18.254 --> 02:31:19.497
Raju, get on the table

1953
02:31:19.753 --> 02:31:22.916
Push the baby down, like this

1954
02:31:23.087 --> 02:31:24.034
Ok

1955
02:31:25.128 --> 02:31:26.041
Farhan, turn it on

1956
02:31:30.628 --> 02:31:32.951
C'mon, you can do it

1957
02:31:34.086 --> 02:31:36.539
C'mon, push

1958
02:31:40.711 --> 02:31:43.282
Do it for Champ

1959
02:31:43.502 --> 02:31:45.955
C'mon, Mona

1960
02:31:47.669 --> 02:31:49.742
He's coming out;

1961
02:31:51.086 --> 02:31:52.874
You can do it

1962
02:31:53.668 --> 02:31:56.038
Yes Mona, push

1963
02:32:03.877 --> 02:32:04.954
Farhan, turn it off

1964
02:32:05.043 --> 02:32:06.073
Ok, off

1965
02:32:26.334 --> 02:32:28.123
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1966
02:32:28.417 --> 02:32:30.621
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1967
02:32:31.333 --> 02:32:33.371
Get scissors
- Be careful

1968
02:32:34.583 --> 02:32:36.869
Cut at the center,
get a towel

1969
02:32:39.666 --> 02:32:41.989
Pia, he's not crying

1970
02:32:46.249 --> 02:32:49.164
Hey Champ!

1971
02:32:50.499 --> 02:32:52.952
Rancho, rub his back

1972
02:32:55.207 --> 02:32:57.245
Hey Champ
- Come on, Champ

1973
02:32:59.082 --> 02:33:01.202
No, nothing

1974
02:33:01.665 --> 02:33:02.696
Blow air into his mouth

1975
02:33:09.873 --> 02:33:10.703
C'mon, Champ

1976
02:33:16.248 --> 02:33:17.113
No response

1977
02:33:41.456 --> 02:33:45.069
Hush Mona, say -
All is well

1978
02:33:50.330 --> 02:33:51.277
He kicked

1979
02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:53.444
What?

1980
02:33:54.329 --> 02:33:55.609
He kicked

1981
02:33:59.079 --> 02:34:00.406
Say: All is well

1982
02:34:01.329 --> 02:34:08.948
All is well

1983
02:34:50.369 --> 02:34:53.734
If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'

1984
02:34:53.869 --> 02:34:55.740
I would've broken his jaw

1985
02:34:56.410 --> 02:34:59.243
But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us

1986
02:34:59.535 --> 02:35:02.699
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1987
02:35:03.744 --> 02:35:06.776
Be what you want to be

1988
02:35:23.243 --> 02:35:27.153
Wait: I've not finished with you!

1989
02:35:29.534 --> 02:35:32.069
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1990
02:35:32.451 --> 02:35:34.855
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1991
02:35:35.617 --> 02:35:37.903
If a pencil tip breaks

1992
02:35:38.076 --> 02:35:43.988
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1993
02:35:44.116 --> 02:35:46.071
You were wrong

1994
02:35:47.658 --> 02:35:49.530
You cannot be right all the time

1995
02:35:51.616 --> 02:35:52.647
You understand?

1996
02:35:55.074 --> 02:35:55.939
Yes, sir

1997
02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.320
This was an important invention

1998
02:36:00.616 --> 02:36:01.646
You understand?

1999
02:36:03.032 --> 02:36:03.897
Yes, sir

2000
02:36:06.365 --> 02:36:15.644
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

2001
02:36:33.697 --> 02:36:38.154
Go, study;
Pass your exams and leave

2002
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:49.152
And now, Student of the Year...

2003
02:36:49.363 --> 02:36:51.853
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

2004
02:37:09.488 --> 02:37:10.815
Sir, one photo

2005
02:37:28.279 --> 02:37:31.727
I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home

2006
02:37:33.779 --> 02:37:39.147
That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried...

2007
02:37:39.445 --> 02:37:41.103
We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year...

2008
02:37:41.778 --> 02:37:45.226
Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time

2009
02:38:19.152 --> 02:38:20.099
Untie him

2010
02:38:23.443 --> 02:38:25.350
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2011
02:38:39.817 --> 02:38:40.682
Raju

2012
02:38:59.691 --> 02:39:01.682
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2013
02:39:02.232 --> 02:39:03.311
But where is he?

2014
02:39:07.775 --> 02:39:09.018
Don't pee here

2015
02:39:10.108 --> 02:39:11.730
Go away creatures

2016
02:39:12.107 --> 02:39:15.188
Don't pee here
- I'll smack you

2017
02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:35.144
Bingo; He cannot be far

2018
02:39:46.606 --> 02:39:48.893
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

2019
02:39:49.023 --> 02:39:51.013
He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2020
02:39:51.106 --> 02:39:53.310
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2021
02:39:53.439 --> 02:39:56.141
Calm down. Come with me

2022
02:39:58.606 --> 02:39:59.518
Where's he?
- Rancho

2023
02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:10.060
Farhan, he's read all your books

2024
02:40:16.355 --> 02:40:22.387
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2025
02:40:25.896 --> 02:40:29.391
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2026
02:40:31.313 --> 02:40:34.512
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2027
02:40:34.771 --> 02:40:36.844
Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2028
02:40:37.771 --> 02:40:41.764
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2029
02:40:46.811 --> 02:40:51.303
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2030
02:40:52.144 --> 02:40:53.139
How did you get here?

2031
02:40:53.228 --> 02:40:56.475
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2032
02:40:56.728 --> 02:41:00.473
It said: 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2033
02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:03.175
That rascal Rancho;

2034
02:41:07.352 --> 02:41:08.347
Where is that idiot?

2035
02:41:19.519 --> 02:41:21.426
Dorje, you fly it

2036
02:41:36.392 --> 02:41:41.843
Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride

2037
02:41:42.809 --> 02:41:45.095
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

2038
02:41:45.725 --> 02:41:48.474
and come close to kiss me

2039
02:41:52.058 --> 02:41:53.302
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2040
02:41:55.641 --> 02:41:56.423
No

2041
02:41:58.266 --> 02:41:59.179
Sorry

2042
02:41:59.558 --> 02:42:00.388
Did you marry?

2043
02:42:00.975 --> 02:42:05.218
What? No

2044
02:42:06.183 --> 02:42:08.802
You?
- Almost... Idiot

2045
02:42:16.391 --> 02:42:17.256
So?

2046
02:42:18.724 --> 02:42:19.719
So what?

2047
02:42:20.224 --> 02:42:21.552
Do you love someone?

2048
02:42:25.974 --> 02:42:26.803
Yes

2049
02:42:32.848 --> 02:42:33.713
Who?

2050
02:42:34.974 --> 02:42:35.886
You

2051
02:43:01.597 --> 02:43:04.797
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2052
02:43:06.014 --> 02:43:06.843
That's right;

2053
02:43:07.097 --> 02:43:08.211
Rancho

2054
02:43:09.722 --> 02:43:10.586
Hi... Farhan;

2055
02:43:10.763 --> 02:43:12.884
Screw your 'Hi'

2056
02:43:13.305 --> 02:43:18.045
Hey, listen to me...
- No, you listen to me

2057
02:43:18.221 --> 02:43:20.508
I can explain everything

2058
02:43:21.596 --> 02:43:22.460
Hi... Raju;

2059
02:43:25.888 --> 02:43:27.085
How we hunted for you;

2060
02:43:27.305 --> 02:43:31.428
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2061
02:43:33.471 --> 02:43:35.758
Add a couple from me too

2062
02:43:36.304 --> 02:43:41.506
Rascal, scoundrel
- Let him go now

2063
02:43:41.637 --> 02:43:42.585
Ok ok, enough

2064
02:43:43.928 --> 02:43:45.718
On your feet, c'mon

2065
02:44:15.719 --> 02:44:17.461
Having fun, idiots?

2066
02:44:17.719 --> 02:44:19.591
Hey... Hi Chatur

2067
02:44:19.885 --> 02:44:24.957
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2068
02:44:25.385 --> 02:44:32.176
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2069
02:44:34.094 --> 02:44:38.833
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2070
02:44:39.385 --> 02:44:42.299
from engineer to primary teacher

2071
02:44:44.468 --> 02:44:47.382
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000 /-?

2072
02:44:47.759 --> 02:44:49.549
For me that's $ 100

2073
02:44:49.967 --> 02:44:53.380
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2074
02:44:53.509 --> 02:44:56.341
Cut the crap
- Crap is what he gave us

2075
02:44:56.509 --> 02:45:01.581
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2076
02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:04.714
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2077
02:45:04.842 --> 02:45:06.251
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2078
02:45:06.425 --> 02:45:07.337
Just relax

2079
02:45:07.425 --> 02:45:14.216
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2080
02:45:15.883 --> 02:45:22.673
Sign here.
Accept: You lost, I won!

2081
02:45:22.924 --> 02:45:25.957
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2082
02:45:26.132 --> 02:45:28.207
Chatur
- Crazy guy

2083
02:45:29.966 --> 02:45:34.339
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2084
02:45:34.757 --> 02:45:36.167
Forget it, man

2085
02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:40.537
This is for winners, not losers

2086
02:45:41.632 --> 02:45:48.623
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2087
02:45:50.757 --> 02:45:53.589
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2088
02:45:55.090 --> 02:45:57.874
He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him

2089
02:45:58.006 --> 02:45:59.499
He's full of crap

2090
02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:04.247
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2091
02:46:04.631 --> 02:46:08.672
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad: Yuck;

2092
02:46:09.422 --> 02:46:10.915
By the way,
what is your real name?

2093
02:46:11.755 --> 02:46:12.668
Phunsukh Wangdu

2094
02:46:13.464 --> 02:46:14.376
Wangdu?

2095
02:46:14.547 --> 02:46:15.411
Pia Wangdu!

2096
02:46:16.089 --> 02:46:17.830
You mean you're a scientist?

2097
02:46:18.047 --> 02:46:19.374
You have 400 patents?

2098
02:46:19.505 --> 02:46:21.377
I won't change my name
after marriage

2099
02:46:21.422 --> 02:46:23.044
You mean you're Chatur's
Wangdu?

2100
02:46:23.089 --> 02:46:25.328
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2101
02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:26.293
I don't like Wangdu

2102
02:46:26.879 --> 02:46:29.084
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2103
02:46:29.505 --> 02:46:31.412
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2104
02:46:31.505 --> 02:46:33.625
So you are
TH E Phunsukh Wangdu?

2105
02:46:33.671 --> 02:46:34.833
Yes, yes;

2106
02:46:36.087 --> 02:46:39.003
Hey Silencer
- Hey Chatur, come back

2107
02:46:40.255 --> 02:46:41.368
Take that

2108
02:46:42.879 --> 02:46:45.202
Wait, I'll stop him

2109
02:46:53.087 --> 02:46:56.702
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2110
02:46:57.212 --> 02:46:58.456
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2111
02:46:58.504 --> 02:47:00.874
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2112
02:47:01.379 --> 02:47:03.416
What sir? Why sir?

2113
02:47:03.628 --> 02:47:06.460
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2114
02:47:08.336 --> 02:47:10.327
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2115
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:14.877
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2116
02:47:18.377 --> 02:47:19.871
Mr. Wangdu...?

2117
02:47:20.044 --> 02:47:21.241
Yes, Chatur?

2118
02:47:22.044 --> 02:47:24.035
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2119
02:47:27.169 --> 02:47:28.828
...S for Screwed

2120
02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:40.084
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2121
02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:42.083
Totally floored me. Good one

2122
02:47:42.752 --> 02:47:47.041
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2123
02:47:47.210 --> 02:47:50.410
Hey Chatur: take that

2124
02:47:51.043 --> 02:47:53.034
I was just joking, man

2125
02:47:53.418 --> 02:47:57.282
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2126
02:47:58.293 --> 02:48:00.082
You're fibbing

2127
02:48:00.167 --> 02:48:02.122
No, really, I swear

2128
02:48:02.209 --> 02:48:04.200
Rancho: 100, Chatur: 0

2129
02:48:04.584 --> 02:48:06.907
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2130
02:48:08.293 --> 02:48:09.701
Beware of farts

2131
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:14.040
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2132
02:48:14.125 --> 02:48:16.495
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life;

2133
02:48:20.208 --> 02:48:24.284
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2134
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:27.785
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated

2135
02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.071
Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down

2136
